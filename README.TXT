Leo 4.10 contains 9 months of intense work on Leo. Several very important
features are subtle; you could almost call them Easter Eggs, so please read
the following notes carefully.

The highlights of Leo 4.10:
--------------------------

* Dozens of new and improved features and commands, including...
  - Tab completion now shows all @command & @button nodes.
  - Leo tabs may be detached from the main window.
  - The Open With menu now works.
  - The leoInspect module answers questions about Python code.
  - Leo can highlight the pane containing the focus.
  - The bigdash plugin searches across multiple files.
  - Improved abbreviation capabilities.
  - Improved handling of URL's.
  - Improved editing of non-Leo files.
  - Improvements create "weightless" unit testing.
* Easier installation on MacOS.
* Fixed almost 70 bugs.
