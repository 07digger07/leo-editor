The highlights of Leo 4.9:
--------------------------

- The Qt gui completely replaces the Tk gui--Qt gui now has all essential
  features of Tk, including plugins.

- Completed Leo's autocompleter.

- The rendering pane can now display movies, html, svg images, etc.

- The scrolledmessage plugin can now use the rendering pane.

- Nodes may contain multiple @language directives.

- Leo highlights URL's everywhere. Ctrl-click URL's opens them in your web
  browser. 

- Leo uses an @file node's extension by default if there is no @language
  directive in effect.
  
- Unified extract and import commands.

- Leo can now colorize multiple @language directives in a single node.

- Plain up/down arrow keys in headline-editing mode select a new node.

- New commands to insert, delete, change or print uA's.

- Added namespace directive to .leo files.

- Fixed many bugs, some important, others merely annoying.
