Leo 5.5 March 23, 2017, Revised May 9, 2017.

[Leo](http://leoeditor.com/) 5.5 is now available on [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/leo/files/Leo/) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor).

Leo is an IDE, outliner and PIM, as described [here](http://leoeditor.com/preface.html).

Simulating Leo's features in Vim, Emacs or Eclipse is possible, just as it is possible to simulate Python in assembly language...

**The highlights of Leo 5.5**

- Syntax coloring is 20x faster than before.
  The "big-text" hack is no longer needed.
- Leo's importers are now line/token oriented, allowing them
  to handle languages like javascript more robustly.
- New perl and javascript importers.
- Pylint now runs in the background.
- Pyflakes can optionally check each file as it is written.
- Greatly simplified argument-handling for interactive commands.
- Documented how to do Test-Driven Development in Leo.
