# This part of the tree shows views of the outline related to specific

# convention.
# 
# I create a new view by cloning headlines that relate to its task, and moving 
# the cloned headlines under the task headline.  This greatly increases my 
# focus.  Any changes made in a task view to clone headlines affect the other 
# clones scattered throughout the outline.  In particular, all @file nodes 
# containing changed clones become marked as dirty, so they will be written 
# when the entire outline is saved.

@nocolor-node

It looks like you should be able to put the following in an
@font node, and get restructured text bold to appear in bold onscreen:

rest_keyword2_font_size = 16
rest_keyword2_font_family = Bitstream Charter
rest_keyword2_font_slant = roman
rest_keyword2_font_weight = bold

However nothing happens when I do this. The python examples in the
test.leo file work fine for me, so I'm not sure what's gone wrong.

I think that the following should also work, but it's also currently
not doing anything for me:

@color rest_keyword2_color = black

==================

Rev 2706 fixes a significant colorizer bug that caused your problem.
Previously, the colorizer inited the so-called configuration tags only
once, which is wrong. These tags are what the @font settings specify.
Now, the colorizer inits the tags when the language changes when
switching nodes.  Usually the language doesn't change, so the new code
will be approximately as fast as the old.
