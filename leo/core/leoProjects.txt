# This part of the tree shows views of the outline related to specific 
# projects or
# tasks. I put such headlines in parentheses, and that is just my convention.
# 
# I create a new view by cloning headlines that relate to its task, and moving 
# the
# cloned headlines under the task headline. This greatly increases my focus. 
# Any
# changes made in a task view to clone headlines affect the other clones 
# scattered
# throughout the outline. In particular, all @file nodes containing changed 
# clones
# become marked as dirty, so they will be written when the entire outline is
# saved.
