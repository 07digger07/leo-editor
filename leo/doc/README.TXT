Leo 4.5 beta 1 is now available at:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3458&package_id=29106

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:

The highlights of Leo 4.5:
--------------------------
- A major revision of Leo's node structures, compatible with so-called unified nodes.
- A major revision of Leo's key-handling code.  Most per-pane key bindings have been eliminated.
- A major revision of Leo's outline drawing and focus handling code.
  Calls to c.beginUpdate and c.endUpdate simply request later redrawing in c.outerUpdate.
- The beginning of usable vim-like bindings.  More support is coming.
- Many small improvements and bug fixes.
