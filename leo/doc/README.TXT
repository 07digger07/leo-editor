The highlights of Leo 4.7:
--------------------------

- Leo now uses the simplest possible internal data model.
  This is the so-called "one-node" world.
- Leo supports Python 3.x.
- Leo requires Python 2.6 or above.
- Several important improvements in file handling.
    - Leo converts @file nodes to @thin nodes automatically.
    - Leo creates a 'Recovered Nodes' node to hold data that
      otherwise might be lost due to clone conflicts.
    - @auto-rst now works much more reliably reliably.
    - Leo no longer @noref trees.  Such trees are not
      reliable in cooperative environments.
- A new Windows installer.
- Many other features, including new command line options and new plugins.
- Dozens of bug fixes.
