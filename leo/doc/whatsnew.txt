What's New in Leo 4.7

.. .. contents::
.. @+node:ekr.20100129054823.11926: *4* @rst-no-head links
.. Links used in this document.
.. @+node:ekr.20100129054823.17680: *4* Leo supports Python 3.x
Leo requires Python 2.6 or above, including Python 3.0 and above.
.. @+node:ekr.20100129054823.11928: *4* Improved file handling
- Leo now treats @file nodes just like it treats @thin nodes. This makes Leo
  much safer to use in cooperative environments that use source code control
  systems. As part of this change, Leo no longer supports @noref nodes.

- @auto-rst now works much more reliably.

- Leo now has a simple, robust, and extremely useful scheme to recover from
  clone conflicts, no matter how they may arise. This removes all the dread from
  "node changed" messages. It is easy to see what the changes were, and it is
  easy to choose what, if anything to do.

  When a clone conflict occurs, you will see a red message in the log pane and a
  "Recovered Nodes" node as the last top-level node. This node has one child per
  red message. Each of these children contains two nodes: an "old" node and a
  "new" node. Unless there are multiple conflicts for a single node, the "new"
  node will have "won": every clone contains the new node's headline and body
  text. All these nodes are plain nodes, *not* clones. It is up to you to change
  the corresponding clone nodes if you choose to do so.

- Leo minimizes unnecessary changes to .leo files. Leo writes outline-size and
  orientation to the cache in your .leo directory. This eliminates unnecessary
  changes to .leo files.

- Leo now creates temporary files in the systems standard temporary directory.
  This prevents Leo from over-writing user-generated .bak files.
.. @+node:ekr.20100129054823.11931: *4* New command-line options
- The --debug command-line option sets g.debug.

- The --version command-line option causes Leo
  to print it's version and exit.

.. @+node:ekr.20100211221936.7098: *4* New commands
- The clear-cache and clear-all-caches commands.
.. @+node:ekr.20100129054823.11934: *4* New settings
The qt colorizer now supports font specifications in @font nodes.
.. @+node:ekr.20100129054823.11935: *4* Improved plugins
Added options for vim plugin. The setting::

    @string vim_trigger_event = icondclick2

is the default. It opens vim when the user double-clicks the icon box.
Alternatives are::

    @string vim_trigger_event = iconclick2
    @string vim_trigger_event = select2

The former opens vim on single clicks in the icon bar.
The latter opens vim whenever a new node is selected in Leo.

.. @+node:ekr.20090620073906.12095: *4* Improved unit testing
- leoDynamicTest.py now supports a --path argument giving the .leo file.
  This is so useful!

- leoDynamicTest.py now honors the --silent argument.

- leoTest.runUnitTestLeoFile runs all unit tests in a given .leo file
  in a separate process.

- leoTest.runTestsExternally calls runUnitTestLeoFile after creating
  dynamicUnitTest.leo.

- When reporting that no unit tests were found, all unit tests commands tell
  whether the entire outline or just the selected outline was searched.
  This fixes sometimes-misleading error messages.

- test.leo contains a 'run-test.leo-tests' button.

- leoPy.leo contains a 'run-all-core-tests' button.
.. @+node:ekr.20090324145450.23: *4* Improved file handling
- Leo opens a default .leo file if no other is specified, using the @string
  default_leo_file setting. The default for this setting is
  ~/.leo/workbook.leo

- Added escapes for underindented lines. The escape is specified by the @string
  underindent-escape-string setting. By default, this escape is \- If a line
  starts with \-N, Leo will write the line with N fewer spaces than expected.

- Leo now warns when attempting to write a file that has been changed outside of
  Leo. This prevents bzr reversions.

- Leo tests syntax of .py files when saving them.

- Leo can now open any file into an @edit node. This allows Leo to be associated
  with the edit action of .py files. Like this::

    C:\Python26\python.exe "c:\leo.repo\trunk\launchLeo.py" --gui=qt %1 %2

- Leo now warns if when writing an @auto node if the the file exists and the
  node has not been read previously.  This prevents a newly-created
  @auto node from overwriting an existing file.
.. @+node:ekr.20090620082840.5608: *4* Improved handling of rST files
Added support for @auto-rst nodes. These import reStructuredText (rST) files
so that the files can be "round-tripped" without introducing extraneous changes.
This makes Leo a superb environment for using rST.
.. @+node:ekr.20090324145450.27: *4* New code features
- Added autoCompleter.getExternalCompletions.
  See http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/4ad91984a6d0acac

- Added g.posList.

- c.config.doEnabledPlugins sets g.app.config.enabledPluginsFileName

- Added the following properties:
    - p.b, t.b and v.b return the body string of the position or node.
    - p.h, t.h and v.h return the head string of the position or node.
    - t.u and v.u return the uA of the node.
    - p.gnx, t.gnx and v.gnx return the gnx of the position or node.

- Added script to leoSettings.leo to ensure all menu items are valid.

- c.config.getSettingSource(setting_name)
  returns the name of the file which Leo used to determine the setting:

    - D indicates default settings.
    - F indicates the file being loaded
    - L indicates leoSettings.leo
    - M indicates myLeoSettings.leo

- Predefined 'self' in @test/@suite nodes.

- Added c.getNodePath and c.getNodeFileName.
  See http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/3b5f1232ecc6bba7
.. @+node:ekr.20090324145450.36: *4* New command-line options
- The --config command-line option specifies a single config (.leo) file
  to use for configuration.
  See http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/f3f95d93bcd93b94

- The --file=fileName command-line option load a file.
  Only .zip and .leo extensions are allowed at present.

- The --gui=name command-line option specifies the gui to use.
  The valid values are --gui=qt, --gui=tk
.. @+node:ekr.20090324145450.40: *4* New commands
- Added smart home (back-to-home) command.

- Added support for standard behavior of Tab and Shift-Tab keys.
  The tab key indents the text selection, if there is one;
  otherwise, the tab key insert a tab or blanks, depending on the @tabwidth setting.
  Shift-Tab always unindents one or more lines.

- The open command creates @edit nodes when opening non-.leo files
  The open file dialog now shows all files by default.
  Selecting a non-.leo file will load that file into a new node in the present outline.

- Added added pdb minibuffer command.
  This works, but stops Leo in the middle of the command-handling logic.
  You may get the commander c by stepping out into
  k.masterKeyHandler or k.masterCommandHandler.
  Using c, you can then get all other info.

- Improved the isearch commands.

- find-clone-all is a synonym for clone-find-all.

- open-quickstart-leo command opens leo/doc/quickstart.leo.

- The Alt-Right and Alt-Left keys (expand-and-go-right and contract-or-go-left
  commands) now move to the previous or next node if now left/right movement is
  possible.
.. @+node:ekr.20090324145450.46: *4* New and improved directives
- Added @nocolor-node directive.

- Improved \@path handling.
.. @+node:ekr.20090324145450.49: *4* New settings
- @string default_leo_file = ~/.leo/workbook.leo

- @string underindent-escape-string = \-

- @int icon_bar_widgets_per_row

- Added support for meta keys.
  http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/b6a39ed672a28c65?pli=1

- The qt gui is now the default.

- The old bindings bound the PageUp/Down keys to back/forward page commands, and
  these commands work only for text.

  The new default bindings in leoSettings.leo: @keys EKR bindings are::

    back-page                       ! text = PageUp
    back-page-extend-selection      ! text = Shift-PageUp
    forward-page                    ! text = PageDn
    forward-page-extend-selection   ! text = Shift-PageDn

    scroll-down-half-page   ! tree = Shift-PageDn
    scroll-down-page        ! tree = PageDn
    scroll-up-half-page     ! tree = Shift-PageUp
    scroll-up-page          ! tree = PageUp    

- @bool enable_alt_ctrl_bindings.
  The default is False, needed for AltGr functionality on Windows.
.. @+node:ekr.20090324145450.54: *4* Plugins
- Improved nav_buttons plugin and corresponding nodeHistory class.

- Created qtGui and tkGui plugins.

- Created leoGuiPluginsRef.leo.

- Leo issues an error message if a non-existent plugin appears
  in an @enabled-plugin node.

- New plugins: spydershell.py, qtframecommands.py, and mod_framesize.py.

.. _`Chapter 23`:           atShadow.html
.. @+node:ekr.20080806211440.188: *4* Major new features
- Added support for @shadow files.
  This is a major breakthrough.
  See `Chapter 23`_ for full details.

- Added much improved support for vim bindings.

- Allow v.uA's in @thin and @shadow nodes.
  See http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/750bb3099090f5b
.. @+node:ekr.20080806211440.253: *4* Major code reorganizations
- Leo now uses a sax-based parser to read .leo files.
  This makes it possible to extend Leo's file format without invalidating previous versions of Leo.

- Leo now supports the so-called 'Graph World'.
  When g.unified_nodes is True, Leo moves all information from tnodes into vnodes.

- Leo now uses a new key binding scheme.
  This allows substantially simpler key bindings. Indeed, most per-pane bindings
  have been eliminated.
  Added support for kill bindings.

- Leo is now an installable package.
  To make this work, Leo adds os.curdir to sys.path if needed on startup.

- Reorganized Leo's drawing and focus code.
  As a result, calls to c.beginUpdate and c.endUpdate are no longer needed.

- Leo is now ready for Python 3.x:
  Change most print statements to calls to g.pr.
.. @+node:ekr.20080806211440.256: *4* Minor new features
- Added g.Tracer class.  This is a Python 'debugger' that computes a call graph.
  To trace a function and its callers, put the following at the function's start::

    g.startTracer()

- The find-character command now finds characters across line boundaries.

- Set cwd in read/write commands. This affect the following commands:
  open, save, save-as, save-to, read-outline-only, read-file-into-node,
  write-file-from-node and all the import/export commands.

- Leo creates the .leo folder in the user's HOME directory, and puts several configuration files there.
  Leo looks for myLeoSettings.leo in HOME/.leo.
  Leo uses os.path.expanduser("~") if there is no home setting.
.. @+node:ekr.20080806211440.189: *4* New settings
- The default settings for @shadow files are now located in leoSettings.leo in the node::

    @settings-->File options-->Shadow files

  The defaults for these settings are::

    @string shadow_prefix = x
    @string shadow_subdir = .leo_shadow

- Added support for @bool fixedWindow option. Leo suppresses marks, expansion
  state, orphan bits and current position bits when writing fixed .leo files. As
  a result, all nodes will be collapsed and the root node will always be
  selected when Leo opens a fixed .leo file.

  You can optionally specify the size and position on the screen of fixed .leo
  files by putting an '@data fixedWindowPosition' node in the
  @settings tree of myLeoSettings.leo or leoSettings.leo.  You should
  **not** put such a node in the fixed .leo file itself--everyone who
  opens the file would get that fixed position.

  The body of the '@data fixedWindowPosition' node should contain
  something like this::

    # Must be four entries: width,height,left,top.
    # Put this in myLeoSettings.leo, **not** in individual .leo files.

    1200
    800
    50
    50

- Added @bool cleo_color_ignore = True
  This determines whether cleo colors @ignore headlines. The default is True.

- All import commands now honor \@path

- Leo now supports arguments to minibuffer commands.

- Leo can now translate messages sent to Leo's log. Rather than using an '_'
  function to denote strings to be translated, Leo's g.es and g.es_print
  functions translate "odd" (first, third, fifth) arguments, leaving "even"
  arguments untranslated. Keyword arguments, color, newline, etc. are never
  translated. g.translateString does the actual translation using Python's

  automatically save the outline whenever an external editor changes the
  outline.

What's New in Leo 4.4.4
##########################################

Leo 4.4.4 contains many important features originally planned for later releases.
The highlights of Leo 4.4.4:

- **The Great Graph Aha**:
  A Leo outline doesn't have to *be* an arbitrary graph in order to *represent* an arbitrary graph.

  That is, simple scripts allow Leo outlines to represent arbitrary
  directed graphs. There is no need for a separate 'graph world'. The graphed.py
  plugin is a direct result of this Aha. It allows you to create general graphs
  from Leo outlines.

- Support for **@auto nodes**.  Such nodes allow people to collaborate using Leo
  without inserting Leo sentinels in the files Leo generates.

- **@menus trees** in settings files create all of Leo's menus.  It is now dead
  easy to make Leo's menus look the way you want.

- **@buttons trees** in settings files create common @button nodes created in all
  Leo outlines.

- A new, faster, **colorizer plugin** replaces the __jEdit_colorizer__ plugin.

- New commands for **resolving cvs conflicts**.

- Leo's core is now compatible with jython.

.. @+node:ekr.20071004103659: *4* The Great Graph Aha
The Great Graph Aha is:

A Leo outline doesn't have to *be* an arbitrary graph in order to *represent* an arbitrary graph.

So the graph world is unnecessary because we can use Leo nodes and trees as data
to other graphing packages.** That is, Python scripts can build arbitrary graphs
using Leo's existing nodes and trees. And Python scripts can manipulate those
graphs. And Python scripts could do the reverse: manipulate the Leo outline by
traversing general graphs. So there is no need to complicate Leo's fundamental
data structures. Hurray! Instead, we build on the strengths of already existing
graphing packages.

The Great Graph Aha created the opportunity for immediate action:

1. test.leo contains the essential scripts to implement graphs in Leo files.
   These short, simple, self-contained, easily modifiable scripts make possible
   everything ever envisaged by the (now-defunct) graph world project::

    leo2graph: convert a normal Leo tree to a NetworkX graph. 
    at-graph2graph: convert an @graph tree to a NetworkX graph. 
    at-networkx2graph: convert an @networkx tree to a NetworkX graph 
    at-networkx2at-graph: create an @graph tree from an @networkx tree.

2. The graphed plugin allows users to manipulate parts of Leo outlines as if
they were general graphs. It is still early days for this exciting plugin.
.. @+node:ekr.20070806090226.15: *4* Added support for @auto files
.. @+node:ekr.20070806095535.1: *5* What @auto does
@auto trees allows people to use Leo in collaborative environments without using
sentinels in the files Leo generates. In contrast to @nosent, @auto trees can
change when the corresponding file changes outside of Leo.

Leo will automatically recreate (import) all @auto trees when reading a .leo
file, and will write all dirty @auto trees when saving a .leo file. There are
two exceptions to this statement:

1. Leo will never read (import) or write an @auto tree if
the root @auto tree is under the influence of an @ignore directive.

2. Saving a .leo file does not save @auto nodes if a) they haven't been changed
or b) they do not contain a **significant** amount of information. An @auto tree
contains a significant amount of information if it has  children or if the
root node contains more than 10 characters.

Leo creates @auto trees by parsing the corresponding external file. Parsers
create descendant nodes of the @auto tree: one node for each class, method and
function in the external file.

Parsers presently exist for C, elisp, Java, Pascal, PHP and Python. Leo
determines the language using the file's extension. If no parser exists for a
language, the entire body of an @auto tree contains a significant amount of
information if it has any children or if the root node contains more than 10
non-blank lines. the external file is copied to the body of the @auto node.

Leo does not write the contents of @auto trees to .leo files. In this respect,
@auto trees work much like @thin trees. @auto trees whose root node is under the
scope of an @ignore directive *will* be written to the .leo, just like @thin
trees.
.. @+node:ekr.20070809141529: *5* Perfect import checks
Leo performs several checks to ensure that the result of importing an external
file will be equivalent to the file that writing the @auto tree would produce.

These checks can produces **errors** or **warnings**. Errors indicate a
potentially serious problem. Leo inserts an @ignore directive in the @auto tree
if any error is found. This @ignore directive prevents the @auto tree from
modifying the external file. If you @ignore directive, a later write of the
@auto tree will attempt to fix the problems that gave rise to the errors. There
are no guarantees however.

**Strict languages** are languages like Python for which leading whitespace is
especially significant. Before importing a file for a strict language, Leo
**regularizes** the leading whitespace of all lines of the original source file.
That is, Leo converts blanks to tabs or tabs to blanks depending on the value of
the @tabwidth directive in effect for the @auto node. Leo cannot guarantee to
reproduce the original source file exactly if problems are discovered while
regularizing leading whitespace.

After importing a file, Leo verifies that writing the @auto node would create
the same file as the original file. For strict languages, the comparison must be
exact, or nearly so. For non-strict languages, differences in leading whitespace
generate warnings, not errors.

File comparison mismatches can arise for several reasons:

1. Bugs in the import parsers. Please report any suspected bugs immediately.

2. Underindented lines in classes, methods or functions in strict languages. An
   **underindented line** is a line that is indented less then the starting line
   of the class, method or function in which it appears. Leo outlines can not
   represent such lines exactly: every line of node implicitly has at least the
   indentation of any unindented line of the node.

Leo will issue a warning (not an error) for underindented Python comment lines.
Such lines can not change the meaning of Python programs.
.. @+node:ekr.20070806101412: *5* Commands related to @auto
Three new commands in the File:Read/Write menu allow you to manually read and
write @auto nodes from the presently selected outline. As always, an @ignore
directive in the @auto node or its ancestors will suppress any of these
commands:

- The Read @auto Nodes (read-at-auto-nodes) command reads all @auto nodes in the
  presently selected outline. An @ignore directive will suppress this import.

- The Write @auto Nodes (write-at-auto-nodes) command writes all @auto nodes. An
  @ignore directive will suppress this import. Caution: the write will occur even
  if Leo has not previously read the @auto node.

- The Write Dirty @auto Nodes (write-dirty-at-auto-nodes) is the same as the
  write-at-auto-nodes command, except that only changed @auto trees are written.

Most users will rarely use these explicit commands, because reading and writing
.leo files handles @auto nodes well enough. However, you can use the
read-at-auto-nodes command to update @auto nodes without having to reload the
.leo file.
.. @+node:ekr.20070806100055: *5* Extending the code: adding new parsers
All present parsers are short overrides of a powerful base parser class. Thus,
it would be simple to add support for other languages. See the node

@thin leoImport.py-->Import-->Scanners for createOutline

in leoPy.leo to see how easy it is to create new parsers.

.. @+node:ekr.20070920092716: *4* New commands for resolving cvs conflicts
The so-called resolve-cvs-conflict project has resolved itself into small,
easily understood commands.

The **read-file-into-node** command prompts for a filename, and creates an node
whose headline is @read-file-into-node <filename> and whose body text is the
entire contents of the file.

The **write-file-from-node** command writes the body text of the selected not to a file.
If the headline of the presently selected node starts with @read-file-into-node
the command use the filename that follows in the headline. Otherwise, the
command prompts for a filename.

When a cvs conflict occurs, the user will:

- read the file into a node using the read-file-into-node command,

- fix the conflict, as with any other editor, and

- write the file with the write-file-from-node command.

Any file can be fixed in this way, including external files and .leo files. The
only complication is that the user must not change sentinel lines. Two new
commands check the contents of a node: The **check-derived-file** and
**check-leo-file** commands tell whether a trial read of the presently selected
node can be done successfully. The check-derived-file command assumes the body
text is a external file; the check-leo-file command assumes the body text is an
entire .leo file.

The **compare-leo-outlines** command prompts for another (presumably similar)
.leo file that will be compared with the presently selected outline file (main
window). It then creates clones of all inserted, deleted and changed nodes.
.. @+node:ekr.20070809145744.5: *4* New kinds of settings trees
.. @+node:ekr.20071001122703: *5* @buttons trees
All @buttons tree in a settings file defines global buttons that are created in
the icon area of all .leo files. You define @button nodes in the @buttons tree
as usual.
.. @+node:ekr.20071004110818: *5* @menus trees
Leo creates its menus from the @menu and @item nodes in the @menus tree. Within
@menus trees, @menu nodes create menus and @item nodes create menu items.

The menu name always follows @menu. If the menu name is 'Plugins', Leo will
create the Plugins menu and populate the menu by calling the
'create-optional-menus' hook. This creates the Plugins menu as usual. Nested
@menu nodes define submenus.

The command name follows @item. If the body text of an @item node exists, this
body text is the menu name. Otherwise, the menu name is the command name.
However, if the command name starts with a '*', hyphens are removed from the
menu name. Menu names and command names may contain a single ampersand (&). If
present, the following character is underlined in the name. If the command name
in an @item node is just a hyphen (-), the item represents a menu separator.
.. @+node:ekr.20070809145744.6: *4* New plugins
- The graphed plugin allows users to manipulate parts of Leo outlines as if they
  were general graphs. It is still early days for this exciting plugin.

- The threading_colorizer plugin replaces the __jEdit_colorizer__ plugin. This
  plugin features an elegant new algorithm that has much better performance and
  eliminates almost all flash.
.. @+node:ekr.20071005100213: *4* Leo's core is now compatible with jython
Essentially all of Leo's startup code now runs with jython 2.2 and the (unfinished!) swing gui.
.. @+node:ekr.20071026180804: *4* Improved prototype for icons in headlines
The prototype in test.leo now will use PIL (Python Imaging Library) if
available, so many more kinds of icons can be used. Buttons now exist to add
icons to do the following:

- Add any icon to any node.
- Delete all icons from a single node or the entire tree.
- Print the icon files associated with a node.
- Print the sizes of icons in a directory.

Fixed a bug in the icon handling in the outline widget that caused
duplicate icons not to be drawn properly.
.. @+node:ekr.20070809145744.7: *4* Minor improvements
- See the release notes for a list of bugs fixed in Leo 4.4.4.

- Added the 'clear-all-marks' hook.

- Added button font setting. See the node: "@settings-->Fonts-->@font button font" in leoSettings.leo.

- Plugins and scripts may call the c.frame.canvas.createCanvas method to create a
  log tab containing a Tk.Canvas widget. Here is an example script::

    log = c.frame.log ; tag = 'my-canvas'
    w = log.canvasDict.get(tag)
    if not w:
        w = log.createCanvas(tag)
        w.configure(bg='yellow')
    log.selectTab(tag)

- Improved the yank and yank-pop commands and added @bool add_ws_to_kill_ring setting.

- Improved the debug command: it now adds the following code to the beginning of debug scripts::

    class G:
        def es(s,c=None):
          pass
    g = G()

- Added the @bool rst3 strip_at_file_prefixes setting.

- Added the g.app.inBridge ivar.

- Added @bool big_outline_pane setting. False (legacy): Top pane contains outline and log panes.
  True: Top pane contains only the outline pane.  Bottom pane contains body and log panes.

- The new leoBridge module allows full access to all of Leo's capabilities
  from programs running outside of Leo.
- Better support for the winpdb debugger.
- Added support for @enabled-plugins and @open-with nodes in settings files.
- Removed all gui-dependent code from Leo's core.

.. @+node:ekr.20070513115832.2: *5* Important new features
- @test and @suite nodes may now be embedded in external files.
- Added support for chapters to Leo's core

  Chapters are regions of a Leo outline whose root is an @chapter node. @chapter
  nodes may appear anywhere in an outline, but the create-chapter command (see
  below) creates @chapter nodes as children of a single @chapters node.

  Selecting a chapter shows the nodes in the selected chapter; in this
  respect, chapters are like hoists. The main chapter represents the entire
  outline and can not be deleted by name. When chapters are in effect, Leo
  creates a hidden @chapters node containing one @chapter node for every chapter
  except the 'main' chapter.

  Associated settings:

  - The @bool use_chapters setting determines whether chapters are enabled.
  - The @bool use_chapter_tabs setting determines whether the chapters
    pop-up menu appears in the icon area. Choosing a chapter name from this list selects a chapter.

  When chapters are enabled, the Cmds:Chapters menu shows all available chapter commands:

  - The create-chapter command creates an @chapter node and with a single node.
  - The delete-chapter command deletes the presently selected chapter.
  - The select-chapter command makes only the nodes of the selected chapter visible.
  - The move-node-to-chapter, clone-node-to-chapter and copy-node-to-chapter commands
    add a node (and its descendants) to another chapter.

- Added support for compressed .leo files

  Leo now has save-file-as-zipped and save-file-as-unzipped commands, and
  corresponding Save File As Zipped and Save File as Unzipped items in the File
  menu. These are exactly the same as Leo's Save As commands except that they
  temporarily force Leo to write the file in either zipped or unzipped format.
  Leo remembers whether a file was originally zipped. The read logic handles
  either zipped or unzipped .leo files automatically. The write logic will zip
  the file if it was originally zipped or if the save-file-as-zipped command is
  being executed. Leo writes files with .leo extension, regardless of whether
  the file is zipped or not. Zipped .leo files contain a single archive, whose
  name is the same as the .leo file itself.

  **Notes**: The new save commands suffice to compress and expand .leo files on
  a file-by-file basis. In particular, there is no need for any user settings.
  Outside of Leo you can change the extension to .leo.zip and use stuffit or
  other program to expand the .leo file contained within. I've only tested this
  on XP, but it should work everywhere...At present the code uses Python's
  zipfile module to read and write zipped files.

- Added leoBridge module.
  See the `leoBridge chapter`_ for full details.

- Removed all (or almost all) gui-independent from Leo's core.

- Improved support for the winpdb debugger.
  See the `debugging with Leo`_ chapter for full details.

.. @+node:ekr.20070513115832.4: *5* Plugins
- The __wx_gui.py plugin is now minimally functional. Alas, some problems
  remain. See the bug list in the plugin for details.

- Changed bindings in the UniversalScrolling plugin.

- Registered the write-restructured-text command in rst3 plugin.
.. @+node:ekr.20070513115832.5: *5* Minor improvements
- See the release notes for a list of the many bugs fixed in Leo 4.4.3.

- Warn on dubious section brackets.
  For details, see http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=4162357

- Added Find and Spell tabs to log pane on startup.
  The spell tab is only shown if Aspell was properly imported.

- Added shortcuts for goto-first/last-sibling commands.

- Made escape in the minibuffer work like ctrl-g.

- Only do one message re writing recent files.

- Added handleUrlInUrlNode helper for OnIconDoubleClick.

- Made copied nodes valid Leo files.
  For details, see http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=4014079

- changeAll now works like findAll

- Clear status line in repeat-complex-command.

.. @+node:ekr.20060929043325: *4* A major code reorg
Leo's vnode and tnode classes are now completely independent of the rest of Leo.
Some api's have been changed.  This 'big reorg' and may affect scripts and plugins.

.. @+node:ekr.20060928172457.4: *4* New features
- Added support for controlling Leo from Emacs_ with pymacs_.
  See `Chapter 18: Leo and Emacs`_ for full details.
- Added Minibuffer and Settings submenus of the Cmds menu.
- At long last Leo creates a proper help menu on the Mac.
- Added a new convention for menu tables. If the first item (a string
  representing the menu label) starts with '*' Leo will convert hyphens to
  spaces and upcase the label. This convention allows a single string to
  represent both the menu label and its associated minibuffer command. As part
  of this reorganization, all menu tables in Leo's core now use only strings.
  This is an essential precondition to supporting @menu nodes in
  leoSettings.leo.
- Leo's Help menu now contains the Open scripts.leo command.
- Leo uses ctypes to import Aspell when run from Python 2.5 or later.
  Leo no longer needs Python-specific versions of aspell.dll.
- Added support for x-windows middle-button paste.
  This only works when the paste is made in the pane containing the selected text.
- Leo looks for myLeoSettings.leo files in the same place Leo looks for leoSettings.leo files.
- Created three scripts (in test.leo) that help create unit tests for Leo's edit commands.
  Create Created runEditCommandTest for use by these scripts.
- Improved print-bindings command.
  The bindings are sorted by prefix: this is a big help in understanding bindings.
  For each prefix, first print items with only a single character after the prefix.
- Made writing .leo files faster.
  The new code almost exactly twice as fast as the old.
- Added p.archivedPosition.
  This is a key first step towards Leap 204.
- Integrated sax with read logic.
- You can now store settings in myLeoSettings.leo without fear of those settings
  being changed by cvs updates or in future versions of Leo.
- Eliminated unnecessary redraws when moving the cursor in the outline pane.
- Much faster navigation through the outline using Alt-arrow keys.
- When focus is in the outline pane, you can move to headlines by typing the first letter of headlines.
- The find command now closes nodes not needed to show the node containing the present match.
- Numerous changes that make Leo easier to use without using a mouse.
- Many new minibuffer commands now appear in the Cmds menu.

Further improved outline navigation:

- Generalized navigation in outline pane to ignore @file, @thin, etc prefixes.
- Made outline navigation cumulative.
  When keystrokes in the outline pane are typed 'close' together Leo first tries to look
  for prefix + ch, where ch is the character just typed and prefix is the previous match.
  The term 'close together' is specified by the setting @float outline_nav_extend_delay.
  The outline search revers to a single-character if the extended search
  fails, so in fact the delay is not too significant. In practice everything works
  well without me thinking at all about what is happening.
.. @+node:ekr.20060928172457.5: *4* New and improved plugins
- Improved the mod_scripting plugin. Every button created by the plugin creates
  a corresponding command. The command name is the 'cleaned' version of the
  button name. Likewise, the plugin also creates a delete-x-button command,
  where x is the command name as just discussed. So now you can delete script
  buttons without right-clicking.
- Made 'About Plugin' dialog scrollable.
- Fixed bugs in groupoperations, multifile, nodenavigator and shortcut_button plugins.
- The rst3 plugin now registers the rst3-process-tree command.
- The leoOPML.py plugin defines commands to read and write OPML files.
- The slideshow.py plugin allows Leo to run slideshows defined by @slideshow and @slide nodes.
- The leo_to_rtf and leo_to_html plugins create rtf and html files from Leo outlines.
- The paste_as_headlines.py plugins creates multiple headlines at once.
- The word_count.py plugin.

Improved the mod_scripting plugin:

- Made showing the Run Script button optional.
- The Script Button button now creates the press-script-button-button command.
- A new utility method does a much better job of massaging button and command names.
.. @+node:ekr.20061009111417.11: *4* Settings
- Removed .leoRecentFiles.txt from the distribution and cvs and added @bool
  write_recent_files_as_needed. The presence or absence of .leoRecentFiles.txt
  no longer controls whether Leo creates and updates .leoRecentFiles.txt.
- Added @bool insert_new_nodes_at_end.
- Added @bool select_all_text_when_editing_headlines.
  Creating a new node always selects the entire text, regardless of this option.
- Leo looks for myLeoSettings.leo files in the same place Leo looks for leoSettings.leo files.
- Added settings for all mod_scripting switches.
- Added @bool collapse_nodes_during_finds.
  This greatly speeds searches that used to open many nodes.
  See: http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3935780
- Added @bool outline_pane_has_initial_focus.
- Added @bool sparse_move_outline_left.
- Added bindings for Alt-Shift-Arrow keys to force an outline move.
- Added @bool use_sax_based_read = False.
  True:  Use a sax-based parser to read .leo files.
  This is slower than using Leo's legacy xml parser, but may solve some unicode problems.

Changed default settings::

    focus-to-body = Alt-D
    focus-to-tree = Alt-T
    toggle-extend-mode = Alt-3
.. @+node:ekr.20060929043325.1: *4* ZODB scripting
Leo's vnode and tnode classes can optionally be compatible with ZODB databases,
i.e., they can optionally derive from ZODB.Persistence.Persistent.

What's New in Leo 4.4
##########################################

This page summarizes the changes made in Leo 4.4.
For full details see the release notes section in LeoDocs.leo.

The main features of Leo 4.4 are:

- An Emacs-like mini-buffer: you can now execute any command by typing its long
  name, with tab completion.

- Many new commands, including cursor and screen movement, basic character, word
  and paragraph manipulation, and commands to manipulate buffers, the kill ring,
  regions and rectangles. You can use Leo without using a mouse.

- Flexible key bindings and input modes. You can emulate the operation of Emacs,
  Vim, or any other editor.

- A tabbed log pane. The Find and Spell Check commands now use tabs instead of
  dialogs, making those commands much easier to use. Plugins or scripts can easily
  create new tabs. The Completion tab shows possible typing completions.

- Autocompletion and calltips.  Autocompletion works much like tab completion.
  To enable autocompletion, bind a key to the auto-complete command.
