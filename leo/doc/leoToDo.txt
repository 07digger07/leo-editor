A clone-marked command should be part of the core.

Make sure you work on http://pastebin.com/f4e9b31d7 version, which
supports undo - and try to fix the undo problem (where nodes still
seem like clones, even if they aren't after undo).

Instead of adding an @ignore directive, it might be better
to change @auto to @@auto.

Should @auto be more lenient with C files?

Improve the recursive import script.
    - Minimize the path names
    - Option to include/exclude the @auto itself

Apparently, the problem is with this line::

Presumably, the ..class:: code..:: should start a new line. There have been

I use Visual Studio 2008, the same that is used for Python 2.5/2.6.

A few days ago, I submitted a patch that allows you to use Mingw32 as a
compiler, too. If you use it, then you need to produce libpython26.a.

For doing this, there is a tool pexport.exe which can do that. I found a website
with those hints, but lost that, again :-) pexport is not included with mingw32.

@nocolor

A pretty feeble start for support for goto-global-line for @nosent files.

A better solution would be to create a string file containing sentinels,
offset the line number by scanned sentinels, then use the existing logic
to get the correct node and line.

@ We use the tnodeList to find a _tnode_ corresponding to the proper node, so the user will for sure be editing the proper text, even if several nodes happen to have the same headline.  This is really all that we need.

However, this code has no good way of distinguishing between different cloned vnodes in the file: they all have the same tnode.  So this code just picks p = t.vnodeList[0] and leaves it at that.

The only way to do better is to scan the outline, replicating the write logic to determine which vnode created the given line.  That's way too difficult, and it would create an unwanted dependency in this code.

http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/ae52bf0ed8e04a59

've just downloaded leo and been very impressed.  Probably I'll use
leo mostly for editing text (as opposed to programs).  Which means
I've turned on text wrapping.

But now, up and down arrows take me to the next line in the file, not
the next line on the screen.  That means I'm always reaching for the
mouse.

Is there a way I can change the arrow key behaviour?
Or should I be editing paragraphs differently (i.e., without text
wrapping)? 

Reply:

I have a vague memory of writing code to get the behavior you describe, but
all details are fuzzy.  I know what you are talking about--it may be one of
the details I've learned to put up with.  In that case, a new option and new
code will be a substantial improvement.  Thanks for this report.

Hmm.  mod_tempfname has a problem.  If it filters out non-ascii unicode characters it will have problem with, say, Chinese file names.  So the naive plan of filtering all characters *except* the valid ascii characters is flawed.

Drat.  I suppose building in unicode smarts: filtering 'general punctuation' characters is needed.  See:

If a @path directive is within the body text of an @thin node then the
file write uses the @path directive but the file read does not.  Since
the file read cannot know of the @path directive until after it has
read the file it has no choice but to not use it.  The @thin file
write code should not use any @path declarations found in its body
text.

http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/2b3b621b36760579

I am a new user of leo and find it most powerful and useful. I did run
into a XML parsing problem that was able to track down and figure out
and I thought to post what I found.

The problem came from pasting in a block of text from a PDF file into
a a node text window and the text happened to have an  'unprintable'
character. After saving the .leo file and reading back the file the
next day, in the whole outline and file became unusable until I
manually tracked down and deleted the bad character in the XML file.

The log ( python ) error was:

reading: C:\x2.leo
error parsing C:\x2.leo
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Leo-4-5-1-final\leo\core\leoFileCommands.py", line 1266, in

I can attach leo files with the error if anyone wants to look at it.
The character does show in Notepad but not the leo text window.

At least this showed the value of plain text XML for leo files for
finding and correcting the problem. And the problem could be called a
python SAX xmlreader problem, and I am not sure if it is possible to
fix in leo code, but my suggestion is to add a .leo reading step that
shows the exact location of characters that can not be translated.
Fortunately my outline was small enough to find the problem character,
but in larger files it would have been very hard to find because none
of the nodes would load from the file.

BTW, I think we should prevent shadow files from accidentally
overwriting valuable stuff:

- Store modification time of the file on shadow import

- When you "save", check if modification time has changed and ask the
user if they really want to overwrite the changes. Or, reuse to do it
altogether and require explicit save-at-shadow-nodes in those
occasions. That's considered "good form" in editors in general, and
since pressing ctrl+S in leo has even more significant implications we
should be absolutely certain everything happens safely.

I'm just getting started learning how to use Leo. Now, I'd like to use
it for some of my projects, but there's no chance that I can convert
everyone at work to using it, so putting sentinel-filled files in our
repository is out of the question. At the same time, my code looks
awfully bare without sentinels because the documentation ends up in
the section names, not the comments!

So, I was wondering if there's a convenient way to pull the section
names into a comment at the start of each section?

===============

Interesting question.  Am I correct in assuming you are using @nosent trees
to generate your files?  If so, it would be easy to add support for the
following options:

@bool write_section_comments_in_at_nosent_trees
@bool write_node_name_comments_in_at_nosent_trees

The first would write a sentinel consisting of only the section name;
the second would write a sentinel consisting only of the node's headline
(for nodes whose headline is not a section name).

These seem like they would be useful additions.  One can even imagine
corresponding Leo directives so that the comments could be turned on or off
within an @nosent tree.

What do you think?

That sounds like an excellent solution. Particularly the last bit --
if you could turn section-comments on and off as required, it would
become very convenient to use Leo to produce source that is intended
to also be read by non Leo users.

3) Now, File->Exit

The point is that I can't kill Leo if I keep saying "Yes" to the
"Save change before quitting" dialog. This is definitely not the
intended behavior. The correct behavior would be to save the file,
give me the warning about the undefined section, and exit.

Summary: inspect when possible, ask for types otherwise.

    os.? gives a list of all instances of os module.
    x.? gives a list of all known classes.
    x.# gives list of all known functions.
    self.? gives all known methods and ivars of the enclosing class.
    The user will be able to specify type conventsions, like Leo's c,g,p,t,v vars.

Completed (mostly): user interface stuff.

Performance isn't too hard:
    - Do all scanning in separate threads.
    - Associate node info with tnodes.
    - Update node info when deselecting a node (in tree base class)

Parsing:
    - Forgiving parser is essentially complete.
    - It's easy to parse python def lines.

Python code completion module


From: "Tal Einat" <talei...@gmail.com>
Date: Wed, 6 Jun 2007 20:57:18 +0300

I've been developing IDLE over the past 2 years or so. Even before
that, I helped a friend of mine, Noam Raphael, write IDLE's
auto-completion, which is included in recent versions of IDLE.

Noam wrote the original completion code from scratch, and AFAIK every
Python IDE which features code completion has done the same. Surely
there is -some- functionality which could be useful cross-IDE?
Retrieving possible completions from the namespace, for example. And
we should be learning from each-others' ideas and experiences.

So how about we design a generic Python completion module, that
each IDE could extend, and use for the completion logic?

From: "phil jones" <inters...@gmail.com>

What functions would we ask for a code completion module?

Presumably recognition of the beginnings of
- a) python keywords
- b) classes and functions defined earlier in this file?
- c) in scope variables?

As python is dynamically typed, I guess we can't expect to know the
names of methods of objects?

A good point. I think we all have been thinking about this. Important
issues for the design is the extraction method and the sources.

*the method*
Importing is a lazy, but accurate way of importing, but is security wise
not such a good idea. Parsing throught an AST compiler is better,
however more difficult. Here are two options.

From version 2.5 the standard Python compiler converts internally the
source code to an abstract syntax tree (AST) before producing the
bytecode. So probably that is a good way to go as every python
distribution has this battery included.

As Nicolas suggested earlier on this mailing list, there is another
option: the AST compiler in python or PyPy:

> http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/module/recparser/

But if it could be done with the standard one it is one dependency less.

*the sources*
In the design we could define first the sources:
1 external imported modules from the pythonpath
2 local modules relative to the current file or context dependent
(Blender, Gimp, ...)
3 inner code

For 1:
It might be a good idea to have a function which scans all the modules
from the pythonpath or one specific module to cache all autocompletion
and calltip information of all classes, methods and doc strings. Why?
Modules in the pythonpath don't change so often. With some criteria
(file name, time stamp, size, ...) you could check if updates are
necessary at startup. Having a readymade 'database' (could be python
dictionary or sqlite database) for autocompletion/call tips would speed
up things (and is also more secure if you are importing rather than
parsing. For example trying to provide gtk autocompletion in a wxPython
by importing is problematic).

For 2:
Here you load the parser on demand. Autocompletion/calltip information
can be added to the database.

For 3:
A different kind of parser needs to be used here as per definition code
you edit contains errors while typing. External modules are retrieved
from 1 and 2, for internal code you can scan all the words and add them
to the autocomplete database. As a refinement you can give special
attention to 'self'. Also for calltips you can inherit when there are
assignments, eg
frame = Frame()
than frame inherits autocomplete & calltip information from Frame.

So autocompletion & calltips deals with two steps: extraction and
'database'. If someone has a good parser already, we could use it.
Otherwise we can define an API for the extraction and maybe lazily
implement it first with importing and concentrate first on the
'database'. When the database is ready we can implement the parsing. You
could also implement the parsing first, but than it takes longer before
you have results. Of course the library is GUI independent, it only
works with strings or lists.

What concerns SPE, it uses importing for autocompletion (1+2) and does
internal code analysis for local code (however without the inheriting).

Tal, how does IDLE's autocompletion works?

How dependent/independent is this from the standard AST compiler or
PyPy? Is it more IDE friendly? Is it based on it or a total independent
implementation?

What concerns me about these is whether they would work in a module

I believe Wing's compiler bit of their code completion is open source.
I remember having seen the code.

It is indeed, but is implemented in C, which means an extra dependency
and not a 100% python solution. Normally modules (especially in the
pythonpath) which you import don't have syntax errors. Maybe logilabs
implementation handles syntax errors well as it is developed for
PyLint. Nicolas?

Well, the dir() builtin does just that, though there can be attributes
which won't be included therein. However, the builtin dir() can be
overridden... and ignoring it can break libraries like RPyC which
define a custom dir() function just for this purpose.

This issue has already been run in to by RPyC (an Python RPC lib). The
main developr went ahead and suggested adding a __dir__ method which
will return a list of attributes, and IIRC he has already implemented
a patch for this, and it will likely enter Python2.6.

Until then, I guess we're going to have to rely on dir for this.

For reference, PyPE auto-parses source code in the background, generating
(among other things) a function/class/method hierarchy.  Its autocomplete
generally sticks to global functions and keywords, but when doing
self.method lookups, it checks the current source code line, looks up in its
index of classes/methods, and trims the results based on known methods in
the current class in the current source file.

It certainly isn't complete (it should try to check base classes of the
class in the same file, it could certainly pay attention to names assigned
in the current scope, the global scope, imports, types of objects as per
WingIDE's assert isinstance(obj, type), etc.), but it also makes the
computation fairly straightforward, fast, and only in reference to the
current document.

> Tal, how does IDLE's autocompletion works?

Much like Stani said, since Python is interpreted, collection of
possible completions splits into two methods:
1) source code analysis
2) dynamic introspection

Of course, we could do either or a combination of both.

IDLE just uses introspection: since IDLE always has a python shell
running, it just completes according to the shell's state (plus
built-in keywords and modules). This is a very simple method,
obviously lacking. It does allow the user some control of the
completion, though - just import whatever you want to be completable
in the shell. However, introspection is all that is needed in a Python
shell, which is the major reason this is the method used in IDLE.

well logilab-astng is basically a big monkey patching of the compiler
package from the stdlib, so you can't get an astng representation from a
module with syntax errors in. However inference and most others
navigation methods (which are basically the value added by astng) are
"syntax error resilient" : if a dependency module (direct or indirect)
contains a syntax error, you don't get any exception, though since some
information is missing you can miss some results you'ld get if the
faulting module were parseable.



From: "Tal Einat" <talei...@gmail.com>
Date: Tue, 31 Jul 2007 10:33:33 +0300

Since astng already does some inference (which we definitely want!)
and is based on the standard Python AST compiler, it sounds like our
#1 candidate. I think we should give the code a serious once-over and
see how well it fits our requirements, and if it can be adapted to
better handle errors. Any volunteers?

Also, has anyone used astng for completion, calltips, or something
similar? Or the standard AST compiler, for that matter?

How does PyPE parse code? Home-rolled, standard AST compiler, something else?

It seems to me we should try to come up with an algorithm for parsing,
before getting to the code. All of the details you mentioned -
noticing assignments, using base-class methods, etc. - could be better
defined and organized this way. Perhaps we could brainstorm on this in
a wiki?

Date: Tue, 31 Jul 2007 11:38:40 +0300

Sorry for being away for such a long time. I hope we can get this
conversation rolling again, and get started with the actual work.

I'll try to sum up what has been said so far, and how I see things.

== Top Priorities ==
* Can we implement a parser based on the standard Python AST compiler
(or astng)? For example, can syntax errors be handled well?
* Is importing reasonable security-wise? If not, can it be made secure?

== General issues ==
* Do we aim for just completion, or also calltips? Perhaps also other
meta-data, e.g. place defined, source code, ... (see IPython's '??')
* Dependencies - do we want to allow C-extensions, or are we going for
a Python-only solution? (IDLE would only use such a Python-only tool.)
It seems that we want to pre-process most of the data in the
background, so I don't see why we would want to do this in C for
efficiency reasons.

== Completion sources ==
1) Importing "external" modules
2) Importing/Parsing "local" modules
3) Parsing the current file
4) Using objects/modules from the shell (e.g. IDLE has both editor
windows and a Python shell)

== Importing ==
* Stani mentioned that importing is problematic from a security point
of view. What are the security issues? Are they really an issue for an
IDE? If so, perhaps we could overcome this by importing in some kind
of "sandbox"?
* What are the pros and cons of Importing vs. Parsing?
* If importing is always preferable to parsing unless there's a syntax
error, perhaps try to import and parse on failure?

== Parsing ==
* This is going to be the most complex method - I think we should have
a general idea of how this should work before starting an
implementation. I suggest hashing ideas out on a wiki, since there a
lot of details to consider.
* Can a parser based on the standard AST compiler (or astng) work? Is
there a way to deal with errors? (HIGH PRIORITY!)
* There are other existing, open-source implementations out there -
WingIDE, PyPE have been mentioned. Any others? We should collect these
so we can use the code for learning, and perhaps direct use (if
possible license-wise).

== Shell ==
This is relatively straight-forward - just use dir(). This should be
optional, for use by IDEs which have a shell (support multiple
shells?).

Some known issues from IDLE and PyCrust:
* Handle object proxies such as RPC proxies (e.g. RPyC)
* Handle ZODB "ghost" objects
* Watch out for circular references
* Watch out for objects with special __getattr__/__hasattr__
implementations (for example xmlrpc, soap)

== Persistence ==
* Stani mentioned a 'database'. I feel Sqlite should be at most
optional, to reduce dependencies.
* Do we really want to have the data persistent (between IDE
sessiosns)? If so, we need to support simultaneous instances of the
IDE so they don't corrupt the data. Any other issues? (I have a
feeling this would better be left for later stages of development.)

One more note: We should distinguish between completion in an editor
and completion in a shell. The conversation up until now has focused
on editors, which is reasonable since that is the problematic scene. I
think a generic Python completion library should support completion in
both contexts, especially if it uses can use a shell's namespace for
completion in the editor.

I have just implemented a completion mockup using Rope (which is a
refactoring library). It works quite nicely, and definitely worth a
look.

http://rope.sourceforge.net/

It even achieves this kind of completion:

class Banana(object):
    def do_something(self):
         return

def foo():
    return [Banana(), Banana()]

foo()[0].<complete> includes do_something

Which seems pretty impressive to me.



From: "Tal Einat" <talei...@gmail.com>
Date: Tue, 31 Jul 2007 20:12:50 +0300

Wow, Rope does look very impressive! A quick look at the code tells me
that a lot of work has been invested in it.

So we have one existing Python-only solution. We should evaluate it -
see what it can and can't do, and perhaps take a look at the overall
design.

I'm CC-ing Rope's developer, Ali. Hopefully Ali can help us quickly
understand Rope's code analysis capabilities.

Ali, could you elaborate a bit on what kinds of completion Rope can
do, and the methods it uses? We would especially like to know how your
static and dynamic inference work, what they can accomplish, and what
their limitations are.

Well, I haven't really looked at the code. But I can tell you this:

from rope.ide.codeassist import PythonCodeAssist
from rope.base.project import Project
for compl in PythonCodeAssist(Project(package_root)).assist(buffer,
offset).completions:
    print compl

And that is as far as I really got. I expect to get a better look at
it later in the week though...

The compiler for syntactically correct Python, a line-based compiler
for broken Python.  TO generate a method list for self.methods, using
the current line number, I discover the enclosing class, check the
listing of methods for that class (generated by the compiler or
line-based parsers), and return a valid list for the specified prefix.
 It doesn't walk the inheritance tree, it doesn't do imports, etc.

A wiki would be fine, the one for this mailing list would likely be
best (if it is still up and working).  Then again, Rope looks quite
nifty.  I may have to borrow some of that source ;)


Discussion subject changed to "Fwd: Python code completion module" by Tal Einat

From: Ali Gholami Rudi <aligr...@gmail.com>
Date: Aug 1, 2007 5:50 PM

First of all I should note that rope's main goal was being a
refactoring tool and a refactoring tool needs to know a lot about
python modules.  `rope.base` package provides information about python
modules.

Actually what ropeide provides as auto-completion is defined in
`rope.ide.codeassist` module.  This module almost does nothing but use
`rope.base`.  Since `rope.ide` package is not included in the rope
library (which has been separated from ropeide since 0.6m4) it lacks
good documentation and the API might not be easy to use (most of it is
written in the first months of rope's birth).

> ..., could you elaborate a bit on what kinds of completion Rope can
> do, ...

I don't know what to say here.  Well, actually it tries to use the
source code as much as possible and infer things from it.  So I can
say that it can complete any obvious thing that can be inferred by a
human.  Like this is the first parameter of a method and after dots
its attributes can appear or these modules are imported so their names
and contents are available or this is an instance of some known type
and we know its attributes and ... .  Try ropeide (it uses emacs-like
keybinding, C-/ for completion; see ~/.rope if you want to change
that); it completes common cases (and sometimes completes things you
don't expect it to!).

> ..., and the methods it uses?

Rope analyzes python source code and AST.  Rope used to use the
`compiler` module till 0.5 and now it uses `_ast` module.

> We would especially like to know how your
> static and dynamic inference work, what they can accomplish

There are a few examples in docs/overview.txt.  Unit-test modules like
`ropetest.base.objectinfertest` and `advanced_oi_test` might help,
too.  Also have a look at `rope.base.oi.__init__` pydoc for an
overview of how they work; (I'm afraid it is a bit out of date and
carelessly written.)  The idea behind rope's object inference is to
guess what references (names in source-code) hold.  They collect
information about code when they can and use them later.

>..., and what their limitations are.

Many things in rope are approximations that might be exact if some
conditions hold.  For instance rope might assume that every normal
reference in module scope holds only one kind of object.  Apart from
these assumptions both SOI and DOI have their own disadvantages; For
instance SOI fails when dynamic code is evaluated while DOI does not.
Or DOI is slower than SOI.  (Well, after recent enhancements to rope's
SOI I rarely use DOI).

I tried to answer as short as possible.  If there are questions on
specific parts of rope, I'll be happy to answer.

By the way, I tried to reply this mail to the group, but it seems that
your group requires subscription for posting, so I've sent it to you,
instead.

Disabled these binding:

auto-complete-force = None # This command needs work before it is useful. Ctrl-period
show-calltips-force = None # This command needs work before it is useful. Alt-parenleft

The problem is that autocompletion depends on state: self.leadinWord,
prevObjects, etc. Thus, it's not presently possible to start the proces
anywhere. Similar remarks apply to calltips, which relies on autocompleter
state.

This is a complex problem, and not very serious now that there is an easy way of
toggling autocompleter and calltips on and off.

In general, autocompletion is a tricky problem. Consider:

- There may be no 'clean' version of the source code that you want to
auto-complete: you may be creating a new node, or a new file, and the source
code, being incomplete, will not parse correctly.

- Except in special circumstances, there is no 'real' object corresponding to s,
so there is no way to use Python's inspect module on s. Modules are an
exception: the autocompleter can handle existing modules fairly well. Try "os."
or "os.path." for example.


It might be possible to generalize c.k.defineObjectDict so that the user
could specify autocompleter conventions, say in an @autocompleter node in an
@settings tree.

Running the latest trunk with the Vim key bindings shows the following
behavior:

Note: all steps below should leave current node in the Command state
(light blue background)

1. Select a node
2. Delete a character ('x' key)
  ! Undo menu item dimmed
3. Go to next node ('Ctrl-J' key)
  ! Undo menu item active
4. Delete a character ('x' key)
5. undo delete ('u' key)
  ! Restores previous node's character

In summary, it appears that any changes to a node's headline are not
placed in the edit history used by the undo command until after
another node has been selected.

4. Repeat last command using the period

Binding keys within nodes:
Some commands can be "easily" repeated by having the command's mode
bind itself to the period key.  This is not currently working.

Support commands requesting input:
Add companion commands that reuse input.  For example, a zap-to-
character-again command could exist which will reuse the key entered
in the last zap-to-character command.  With this support, the mode
that performs the initial command would assign the period key to a
companion mode that is identical to the initial mode but with the zap-
to-character command replaced by the zap-to-character-again command.
Commands requiring companion commands are:
  zap-to-character
  find-character
  backward-find-character
  (Any others?)
Note: The copy of the character should be saved somewhere that does
NOT affect the contents of the clipboard.
Note: The same or a separate storage location can be used for all
commands to retain a copy of the character entered by the user.  It
doesn't matter since only the last command is assigned to the period
key to be re-executed.

Word related commands:
| Vi supports two types of words in its commands: Words that consist

| The "--> mode-help" command has the following issues related to the

Thanks for all these comments.  I'll respond to them all here.

Clearly, we should be using a standard xml parser to read .leo files.

My present thoughts:

- I personally like human-readable headlines in <v> elements.

- I am open to putting headlines in <t> elements, as an indication that
tnodes do indeed contain headlines and body text.

- I am willing to consider only writing shared subtrees once.

Oh! (An Aha)  All these are preferences.  We can allow any combination of
these provided that headlines appear somewhere.

So that's clean.  This will happen in Leo 4.5.

It requires a translation layer, either to (un)munge the name or
(un)pickle. Real problem?

Let's say each time I think 'I can use UAs to store that' I change
my mind when I realize my values will be in a pickle. (I really don't
want to name all my attributes str_xxx)

How is it done in any other XML file?
I've not used XML for arbitrary data, but it probably can be done.

> Why would that way be better than pickle?

My suspicion is that UAs would be used more for
storing text and numbers (as seems common for XML files)
than Python data objects.

Does Leo use UAs to store pickles?

I'm sure pickling capability is great, but I'm not convinced
it should be the _default._

No big deal.

One feature I have not seen in SCS system is something which might be called
"history compression": I might be interested in having both version 5 and 6
in my source tree, when the current version is 7, but I am not really interested
in the 2000 steps which transformed 5 into 6 (just suggested this feature to
the bazaar people). This happens actually quite often to me, since I use the
SCS as a back-up system, saving many (uninteresting) intermediate steps while
implementing a new feature.

- Add support for the following options:
    - expand_noweb_references: default False for compatibility.
    - ignore_noweb definitions: default False for compatibility.

- When expand_noweb_references is True, definitions (typically clones)
  must be descendants of the referencing node (in the @rst tree)

I want to write the documentation for the source program in a @rst3 subtree. In
this @rst3 subtree I want to refer to fragments of the program, like:

In the following code fragment::

  <<code fragment>>

Unfortunately, <<code fragment>> will not be expanded. Furthermore, in order to
get to this work, I should have <<code fragment>> under the @rst3 subtree as
well, but this is then also treated as @rst3 input (which in this case, is not
what I want).

@

This loop writes all output lines using a single writer: new_private_lines_wtr.

The output lines come from two, and *only* two readers:

1. old_private_lines_rdr delivers the complete original sources. All
   sentinels and unchanged regular lines come from this reader.

2. new_public_lines_rdr delivers the new, changed sources. All inserted or
   replacement text comes from this reader.

Each time through the loop, the following are true:

- old_i is the index into old_public_lines of the start of the present SequenceMatcher opcode.

- mapping[old_i] is the index into old_private_lines of the start of the same opcode.

At the start of the loop, the call to copy_sentinels effectively skips (deletes)
all previously unwritten non-sentinel lines in old_private_lines_rdr whose index
is less than mapping[old_i].

As a result, the opcode handlers do not need to delete elements from the
old_private_lines_rdr explicitly. This explains why opcode handlers for the
'insert' and 'delete' opcodes are identical.

Thanks for this report. I think it is important, and needs a good solution.

I dislike all these files being sprayed around the file system. I'd like to see
these files placed somewhere the ~/.leo directory. Is there a reason why this
would be a bad idea?

Similarly, we might also prefer to have shadow files place in, say,
~/.leo/shadow_files.

In both cases, I think we want to create files that indicate their location.
Either that, or mirror their location in (subdirectories) ~/.leo. In other
words, this is a general problem, and it would be good to have a robust, general
solution.

So to create command you would do

import leoPlugins

def mycmd(c,p, event):
  print c,p

leoPlugins.expose_command('my-command', mycmd)
leoPlugins.expose_button('press-this',mycmd)

[EKR: I would rather use g.app.exposeCommand, g.app.exposeButton].

These would be available on *all* new commanders, and the current
commander as well (for easy testing). Plugins would not have to
contain more code than what is presented above.

The idea is to have a global command dict, [EKR: g.app.commandsDict]
and global button dict.
There is one after-create-frame handler that introduces all the
entries in this dict to the commander command dict.
QQQ

============


QQQ
g.app.global_commands_dict, which gets copied to c on commander
creation. it's rev 1889, you'll note that it's a simple
implementation. I didn't add g.button yet. An example:

@g.command('bookmark')
def bookmark(event):
    c = event.get('c')
    p = c.currentPosition()
    bookmarks.append(p.gnx)
    g.es('bookmarked')

I've just became aware of this project to upgrade TK's look and feel
in python (http://gpolo.ath.cx:81/projects/ttk_to_tkinter/). I presume
this can only have positive implications on leo (-:

Here's are some screen shots of the newly themed widgets: (http://

Now that the leo is more "modeless" (I'm speaking of switching between
outline navigation and body editing modes), which btw is a clear improvement
to how leo used to behave, here are some things that still feel a bit
un-intuitive:

- ctrl+H (edit-headline) "locks" the user into the mode way too much.

   * The headline editing mode should be cancelled when the user does:
      - cursor up/down
      - ESC

   * Even better alternative: I find myself constantly thinking that "ok,
now I need to edit a headline (typically not the current headline), so now
I'll press ctrl+H". I think perhaps pressing up/down should cancel the
current headline editing, and select the next/previous headline for editing.
That is, I wouldn't need to navigate to the headline I want to edit before I
start editing it.

  - cut-node (ctrl+shift+x) selects the wrong node after the cut. The
intuitive assumption is that cut will select the node that "took the place
of the
    current node", instead of starting to travel upwards the set of nodes.

   * Typical use case is the way you usually start deleting a set of items.
You move to the first item and start cutting repeatedly. This wont work with
the current behaviour.

When using leo as outliner, I often use only node headlines to write
down some data. If the headline string is too long, the cursor goes
beyond the visible area. When modifying a node headline, is it
possible to make leo to auto-scroll, so the cursor is always visible?

I think there is room for improvement in documenting Leo's
API, making it easier to write these kind of scripts.
I'm not sure of the best way to do that.

Epydoc seems to be the most active project in this realm.

@nocolor

The main difficulty I see in the migration is creating the tables in the getPublicCommands methods in the various classes in leoEditCommands.py.  At present, these tables associate command names (strings) with corresponding methods.  The form of getPublicCommands is always:

def getPublicCommands (self):
  return {
    'command-name1': self.methodName1,
    'command-name2': self.methodName2,
    ...
  }

Thinking out loud, let's see whether the migration can be done easily.  We would change the entry:

    'command-name1': self.methodNameN,

to:

    'command-name1': self.classNameN(self),

That is, the table creates an instance of the class by calling the class's ctor, with self (the container object) as the ctor's only argument.  To make this work, all we need to do is give the class a __call__ method whose signature matches the signature of methodNameN, that is, the signature used to call methods previously.

Well, isn't this nice.  We can transition gradually, as needed.  No need *ever* to do a mass migration.  It should be easy to verify this scheme with one or two examples.  Please report your experiences if you decide to play around with this.

Edward

P.S.  I think it would be good style to append "Class" to the name of each command class. This makes it clear that self.myCommandClass(self) is a ctor.

A lot of people are now using Wink for demonstrations
(http://www.debugmode.com/wink/), it's is free and seems to work well.

Check out http://murl.se/11332
At the bottom they talk about tools and techniques.
http://showmedo.com seems like it would be a good
place to host vids also.

I've listened/watched a fair number of things like this;
my recomendation is to get a good microphone and
pre-amp to record your voice, and prepare the audio
track carefully. It is so aggravating when
it's hard to discern the words being spoken.

Thanks,
Kent

Tutorials would be great. I use Liberty BASIC, (http://libertybasic.conforums.com)
and it has a very good tutorial -- leads the beginner by the hand through much
of the language. Also the help file has working code snippets
to cut-n-paste-n-play-with. I'd like to see something like:

[Buttons]
...[What are Buttons good for?]
...[How do I make my own buttons?]
......[Some commands you can use with buttons]
......[Where to find button commands]

My sense is that documentation/screencasts has the
greatest potential for expanding Leo's mindshare.

I really like those produced by the good folks
at Dabo;
http://leafe.com/screencasts/
http://leafe.com/screencasts/populategrid.html

The TurboGears people have taken this to the extreme;
http://www.turbogears.org/ultimate.html

Leo is different enough that it warrants a 
demonstration of it's advantages.

Three packages that might be candidates for "rendering" slides authored in Leo:

MagicPoint: http://member.wide.ad.jp/wg/mgp/

  uses a text file format that leo could produce

Slidy: http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy/

  uses XHTML / canned Java script

S5: http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/

  Similar to Slidy I think, haven't looked at it
