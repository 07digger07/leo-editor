#@+node:ekr.20110523130519.19220: *6* Report
https://bugs.launchpad.net/leo-editor/+bug/525004

This is basically a copy/paste from
http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/c4b5bd43a9a203f9#

Consider the following code snippet:

--- cut here ---
@language shell

FOO_BAR='foo bar'
FOO1_BAR1='foo1 bar1'

echo $FOO_BAR*
echo $FOO_BAR-$FOO1_BAR1
--- cut here ---

The variable names in the last two lines are not highlighted
correctly. This becomes clear if the first line is replaced with #!/
bin/bash and this code is opened in vim/scite. I've tried only these
two editors, they highlight the variable names correctly.

http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/663e1f9d8e2d1c24

There is a problem with the onClick model for plugins, as described in the
Templates section of the leoPlugins.

The onCreate method gets called every time *any* new commander is created
therefore the plugin controllers get recreated for *every* commander *every*
time a new commander is created.

Leo's sentence related functions:

- do not stop at empty lines.
- do not skip periods within words.
- do not stop at sentences ending in non-periods.
- do not stop at the end or beginning of the buffer.

Note: see forwardSentenceHelper and backSentenceHelper functions.

http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/679614fdd6a76a81#

I think this should be combined with extract-section (ctrl-shift-x), so that

- if the first line of selection is << foo >>, it created a node with
headline << foo >>

- If the  first line is def foo, create a node with headline foo

- Extend as appropriate.

@nocolor
http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3940843
By: ktenney

>the distiction between importing 'foreign' text files and importing derived
files created by Leo.

Couldn't Leo make this distinction by looking at
the file being imported? If so, I think it should.

This could eliminate a lot of confusion IMO, if
I want to bring a file into a node, just
'import' it, and the right thing happens.

An emergency measure could be available in a 
'File Special' menu.

* Develop in an outline containing all of Leo's source files. Close this outline
 rarely: this keeps the code I am using stable while I'm hacking the code.

* Test in a *separate* .leo file, say test.leo. In fact, I often test in a
  private file, ekr.leo, so that test.leo doesn't get continually updated on bzr
  with trivial changes.

These two points are covered in a bit more detail in the FAQ:

http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/FAQ.html#how-can-i-use-leo-to-develop-leo-itself

Additional tips:

A. Avoid using the mouse whenever possible.  For example, use alt-tab to switch between windows.

B. Always develop Leo in a console.  This allows me to see the output of g.trace.

Speaking of g.trace, I hardly ever use 'print' because g.trace prints the name
of the function or method in which it appears. The typical pattern for enabling
traces is:

    trace = True and not g.unitTesting
    if trace: g.trace(whatever)

This pattern is especially useful when a method contains multiple calls to g.trace.

C. I use scripts to open particular Leo files. These are batch files on Windows,
   and aliases on Linux, but invoking them is the same on either platform:

all: opens all my main development files using the qt-tabs gui: leoPy.leo,
     leoGuiPlugins.leo, leoPlugins.leo, leoSettings.leo, myLeoSettings.leo and
     LeoDocs.leo.

t: opens test.leo.

e: opens ekr.leo.  I use this file for private testing.

d: opens LeoDocs.leo.

s: opens LeoPy.leo.

plugins: opens leoPlugins.leo.

gui: opens leoGui.leo.

u: opens unitTest.leo.

These run Leo with Python 3.x. There are similar scripts, ending in 2, that run
Leo with Python 2.x. For example, u2 opens unitTest.leo with Python 2.x.

Similarly, the tk prefix uses the Tk gui: utk opens unitTest.leo with --gui=tk
(and Python 2.x since the tk gui only works with Python 2.x)

Thus, to run a test, I alt-tab to an available console window, then type 'e' or
't' or 'e2' or 't2'.

D. Use clones to focus attention on the task at hand.  For more details, see:

E.  For thousand of example of my programming style, see leoPy.leo and leoGuiPlugins.leo.

http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html#clones-views

The projects section in leoPy.leo contains many examples of using clones to
create view nodes. I typically delete the clones in the views shortly before a
release.

That's about all for code-level tips.  Here are some administrative tips:

A.  Use postings as pre-writing for documentation.

I don't mind blabbing on and on about Leo because all my posts become
pre-writing for Leo's documentation. I simply copy posts to nodes in the
"documentation to-do" section. At release time, I edit these nodes and put them
in Leo's main documentation or the release notes. This posting is an example.

B. Never rely on memory.

A project like this contains thousands and thousands of details. Everything
eventually goes into a Leo node somewhere. If it doesn't it surely *will* be
forgotten.

C. Do easy items first. This keeps to-do lists short, which in turn helps keep
energy high.


============================

> Do you also have any bzr specific gotchas that you plan to add to this
> section?

I use the following batch files related to bzr:

b: short for bzr
bs: short for bzr status
tr: short for cd <path to trunk>
main: short for cd <path to copy of trunk>

The "main" (copy) of the trunk is purely for handling bzr conflicts.
If one happens I do this:

main
b pull
b merge ../trunk
b c -m "my commit message"
b push

If the merge goes well (it usually does), I do:

tr
b pull

This suffices to resolve the conflict.
#@+node:ekr.20110514134640.14520: *5* Doc: summary of autocompleter (do not delete)
@language rest

There has been a lot of work on autocompletion recently. Here, I'll summarize
the present status and indicate future directions.

Terminology: the *legacy* (aka tabbed) autocompleter shows completions in Leo's
tabbed pane. The *new* (aka qcompleter) autocompleter shows completions in or
near the body pane.

Appearance
==========

There is little change to the legacy completer, except that no text is
highlighted in the body pane during completion. This is calmer than before.
Furthermore, there is no longer any need for highlighting, because when the user
types a backspace the legacy completer now simply deletes a single character
instead of the highlighted text.

One more minor change: the legacy completer now *does* insert characters that do
not match the start of any possible completion. This is an experimental feature,
but it might play well with using codewise completions as a fallback to
leo-related completions.

The appearance of the qcompleter is in flux. Previously, the QCompleter ctor
created a wretched-looking window in or near the body pane. The present code
creates a new temporary splitter above the body pane. It looks good, but has the
unpleasant effect of shifting the body pane done.

The consensus seems to be that the completion window should float near the
to-be-completed text, without obscuring it. I'll do this immediately.

Function and design
===================

Both the legacy and new completer now work *exactly* the same way, because they
both use the AutoCompleterClass to compute the list of completions.

In other words, the qcompleter code in qtGui.py deals *only* with gui- related
matters. All policy matters are delegated to AutoCompleterClass.

All completion-related code is stateless, or as stateless as possible. In
practice, this means that ac.compute_completion_list must be called on every
keystroke. That's not a problem: it is extremely fast.

Yesterday I realized that the strict "stateless" requirement means that the
"intermediate" completions must be entered into the body pane while completion
is active. This might be a debatable user-interface choice. It works well as a
visual cue when using the tabbed completer: indeed, the tabbed completer would
be difficult to use without this cue.

The situation is slightly different with the qcompleter. Adding code before the
user accepts the completion might be considered an "advanced" feature. However,
it does have two important advantages, especially when "chaining" across
periods: it indicates the status of the chaining and it limits what must appear
in the qcompleter window.

It would be possible *not* to add the intermediate text into the body pane when
using the qcompleter, but that would have the following disadvantages:

- It would require internal state somewhere, probably in AutoCompleterClass.

- It would require that the complete prefix be visible in the qcompleter window.

For these reasons, I would prefer to have the code remains stateless for both
the legacy and new completers.

Codewise completions
====================

I agree with Ville that the @bool use_codewise setting should be eliminated, or
at the very least made the default. The problem with eliminating the setting
completely is that it might give incorrect results if c, g and p do not mean
what they mean in Leo. Perhaps this is not worth worrying about. In any case,
the codewise completions should be used whenever the eval-oriented approach
fails.

The present codewise-oriented completions appear to work well. In large part,
this is due to adding the global "self." completions to all class-related
completions (kind == 'class' in ac.get_codewise_completions). This looks like a
really good hack, and it eliminates the need for the ContextSniffer class.

Performance
===========

Performance of leo-related completions is *much* better than before. The old
code used Python's inspect module and was horribly complex. The new code uses
eval and is perfectly straightforward.

The present codewise-related code caches completions for all previously-seen
prefixes. This dramatically speeds up backspacing. Global caching is possible
because completions depend *only* one the present prefix, *not* on the presently
selected node. If ContextSniffer were used, completions would depend on the
selected node and caching would likely be impractical.

Despite these improvements, the performance of codewise-oriented completions is
now noticeably slower than leo-related completions.

The present qcompleter code avoids the QCompleter class entirely. This
dramatically speeds up completions and simplifies the code in qtGui.py.

Future directions
=============

Appearance-related issues will soon be completely resolved. When that happens I
shall consider autocompletion to be "complete enough".

I am completely happy with the leo-oriented completions. I'm not looking for
anything better :-)

Falling back to codewise-completions when leo-related completions fail may have
some promise. In fact, the slowness of computing the codewise-oriented
completions in that case might be a subtle clue that something is amiss :-) We
shall see. In any case, it's a small point with no global implications.

The "final frontier" is, as it has always been, improving codewise completions.
As always, this is an open-ended project. The question are, how much AI is
reasonable, and how can performance be improved? Having said that, I am pleased
with ac.get_codewise_completions. It, and its helpers, guess_class and clean,
are relatively straightforward.

I have always considered the codewise completions (or whatever replaces them) to
be the "hard part". There is still a sense in which this is true, but perhaps as
a practical matter Ville was correct in calling this week's work the hard part
:-)

In any case, the codewise completions work surprisingly well. For example, it
suggests all parts of the chain c.frame.body.bodyCtrl.widget except the bodyCtrl
part, and after I type the bodyCtrl part by hand the codewise completer does
suggest widget.

This is all a bit of a hack. The codewise completer suggests far more
completions than are actually valid. Happily, these extra suggestions cause no
pain: typing just a few letters of the next part of the chain quickly removes
most extraneous completions.

The performance and flexibility of the codewise completer are greater concerns.
Now that leo-related completions are so fast, the slower speed of the codewise
completer is just a bit annoying. Caching helps somewhat, but not enough.

By "flexibility" I mean that the user must run ctags periodically to update
completions. One could imagine Leo doing this automatically from time to time,
but such a project would not be trivial.

Summary
=======

User interface issues are nearly resolved: I'll make the qcompleter float today.

Performance of Leo completions are excellent; codewise completions not bad.

Improving codewise completions would be an interesting project, but not urgent.
#@+node:ekr.20110514134640.14521: *5* Doc: the new completion caching scheme (do not delete)
@language rest

QQQ
The completer should calculate all possible completions at that time. now, as
you enter letters b a r, (to get foo.bar), completions should not be calculated
- rather, the original completion list calculated earlier should be pruned
according to the letters typed.
QQQ

The change was elegant: see ac.get_cached_options. This method cuts back the
prefix until it finds a cached prefix. ac.compute_completion_list then uses this
(perhaps-way-too-long-list) as a starting point, and computes the final
completion list by calling g.itemsMatchingPrefixInList.

This may not be absolutely the fastest way, but it is much simpler and more
robust than attempting to do "prefix AI" based on comparing old and new
prefixes. Furthermore, this scheme is completely independent of the how
completions are actually computed. The autocompleter now caches options lists,
regardless of whether using eval or codewise.

And in most cases the scheme is extremely fast: calls to get_completions replace
calls to g.itemsMatchingPrefixInList. However, for short prefixes, the list that
g.g.itemsMatchingPrefixInList scans can have thousands of items. Scanning large
lists can't be helped in any case for short prefixes.

Happily, the new scheme is still *completely* stateless: the completionDict does
*not* define state (it is valid everywhere) and no state variables had to be
added.

In short, the new caching scheme is much better than before, and it probably is
close to optimal in most situations.

http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/9b1dbebd56d50e14/d5a690127ddad38e
 
"Sprint" isn't really the correct term.  We wrote no code.  Instead,
we discussed what seemed to each of us as the most important
directions for Leo.

After much pleasant discussion, we reached agreement, dreaded or not,
on just about everything. I'll summarize the topics here, and
elaborate about file format issues in a separate thread.

1.  (Done) Make .leo files as standards-compliant as possible.

This will demonstrate to newbies that we have some sophistication re
web standards, and it will allow external tools to handle .leo files
in the easiest possible way.

I've delegated the design of this project to Kent.  I'll be in charge
of implementation.

2. Simplify and revise Leo's file format.

Details in a separate thread: some items deserve just a bit more
discussion.  In particular, we want the about-to-be-renamed <t>
elements to contain headline text so that <t> elements represent key/
value pairs directly.  The question is, should the about-to-be-renamed
<v> elements contain headline text (readable, but "denormalized")?

3. Support reading and writing Leo outlines in JSON format.

This will allow closer cooperation with databases and other tools.
I'll do this.

4. Complete the transition to Terry's free_layout plugin.

A. Place separate body editors in free_layout areas.  This should
*easy* to do!  Almost nothing changes in the code, but the visual
effect should be much better.

B. Allow any pane to be "tabified" (placed in a tab in the Log pane)
and "untabified."  There are a few details to be handled, but nothing
major.

Terry and I will collaborate on this.

5. Add global search to the quicksearch plugin and to Leo's find
command.

6. (Abandoned) Add node-specific undo asap.

The present undo is almost useless after a few levels.  Node-specific
undo would be much more useful. This has been on the list forever.  It
should be done yesterday.

7.  Rejected direct support for .ini files instead of Leo's @settings
nodes.

After some discussion we decided that the present .ini importer should
suffice.  In other words, it seems like a bad idea to support .ini
settings *instead* of, or in *addition* to, .ini files.  However,
scripts or commands to import/export Leo settings to one or more .ini
files would be fine.

8.  Make uA's first class citizens.

There should be commands to get and set uA's.  This is easy to do:
it's just an oversight.

Summary
=======

Looking back on the discussions, I am struck once again by how minor
the suggestions are.  Most of these items can be done in a day or two,
or a week or two at most.  The conclusion is that Leo has reached a
mature state.

Kent, Terry, did I omit anything?  Misstate anything?

What Tk plugins must be ported to Qt?

Viktor R: detect_urls.py (Completed)
#@+node:ekr.20110526234609.18387: *6* Posting
I would like to remove support for Tk asap.  Before doing that, I want to make
sure that nobody will lose the functionality of a Tk plugin that has no
counterpart in Qt. 

Therefore, it is important that you tell me now if moving to Qt would
inconvenience you in this regard. True, Tk plugins can be ported to Qt later if
necessary, but I'd like to make the translation as painless as possible. So if
you use Tk, please let me know now if you use any Tk plugin that has no
counterpart in Qt.

In February of this year there was a thread called "What Tk plugins must be ported to Qt?"
http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/16c6fb46a4f84b8c/e5c88a19eba99e68

At that time, only the detect_urls plugin was mentioned, and that functionality
has been moved into the Qt colorizer.

A short script produces this list of @file nodes in the "zz Tk only plugins"
section of leoPlugins.leo:

The only plugins that catch my eye are: autotrees.py, base64Packager.py,

I would prefer not to port color_markup.py. It doesn't seem worth the trouble.
Porting base64Packager.py should be straightforward, if anyone cares.

autotrees.py and templates.py seems the most interesting. They shouldn't be too
difficult to do.

#@+node:ekr.20110526083709.18337: *4* Simplify Key handling
As part of killing Tk I shall simplify how Leo's Qt gui reports keys to the
core.  The general design will be as follows:

1. The leoKeyEvent class will be strengthened. The following improvements will be done
   in leoKeyEvent or its precursors in eventFilter.

2. There will be several "invariants" that the core will depend on:

A. event.ch will be empty except for characters that will, by default, be
   inserted into body text. This includes all printable ascii characters and any
   unicode characters, but does *not* include any ctrl/alt/meta characters.

**Important**: there may be (will be) clashes between some unicode characters
and alt/ctrl/meta characters.  I know of no way to "guess" what is meant, so all
such characters, or at least all such characters with Leo bindings, will be
treated as non-printable. 

B. event.ch will contain the *actual character* represented by the event. In
   particular, it will contain '\t', not 'Tab', '\n', not 'Return', '.', not
   'period', etc., etc.

C. event.stroke will contain the "standard" spelling of the key. As before,
   k.masterKeyHandler will use the stroke to determine the binding in effect for
   the key. There will be no substantial changes to k.masterKeyHandler, except
   as required by invariant B.

The effect of these invariants is that Leo's core will not have to do AI to
determine what character an event refers to.  If event.ch is non-empty, the
character can be inserted (modulo any plain-key bindings).  Otherwise, the
stroke tells everything there is to be known about the key event. 

For example, k.isPlainKey will become trivial, or better, unnecessary.

None of this can be done easily while Tk exists.  After the work is done, the
work will become a new "standard" that future gui's can implement.

Leo's file format: version 3, draft 4

http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/a2b7e5321d62b64/a4cc51d404af94aa

Here is the latest version, with the graphml stuff removed.

This draft is intended to reflect our recent discussions, with no
new invention from me. All comments and corrections welcome.

This draft covers only Leo's xml format, but it may be adapted
for use as a json file format.

Recent changes
==============

- Removed graphml stuff, including leo: prefixes.

- Used "key" in <attr> elements (and "type" in <edge> elements.)

First lines
===========

Leo file will start with the following::

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <?xml-stylesheet my_stylesheet?>
    <!-- Created by Leo (http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/front.html) -->
    <leo_file file_format="3"
        xmlns:leo="http://www.leo-editor.org/2011/leo"/>
        

No session data
===============

There will be no <globals>, <preferences> or
<find_panel_settings> elements. All such "session data" will be
restored from the cache, or from defaults if caching is disabled.

**Important**: there is no representation of expansion state or
the currently selected node anywhere in the .leo file.
Eliminating these data is contingent on having Leo work well with
caching disabled.

Note: marks are more than session data. They must appear
somewhere within <node> elements.


Summary of format
=================

.leo files will have the following form, with similar indentation::

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <?xml-stylesheet my_stylesheet?>
    <!-- Created by Leo (http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/front.html) -->
    <leo_file file_format="3" xmlns:leo="http://www.leo-editor.org/2011/leo"/>
    <graph>
    <nodes>
        <!-- marked attribute appears only if the vnode is marked -->
        <node id="gnx"> 
            <head>headline text</head>
            <attr key="marked">1</attr>
            <!-- uA's... -->
            <!-- format="string" is the default -->
            <attr key="a">a string</attr>
            <attr key="b" format="json">a json string</attr>
            <attr key="c" format="pickle">a pickled string</attr>
            <attr key="d" format="binhex">a binhexed string</attr>
            ...
            <body>body text</body>
        </node>
        ...
        <!-- @file nodes contain a <data> package -->
        <node id="gnx">
            <head>@file x.py</head>
            ...
            <at-file-attributes>
                <attr>key="ua-name"
                    format="(empty)/json/pickle/binhex"
                    gnx="gnx">value
                </attr>
                ...
            </at-file-attributes>
        </node>
        ...
    </nodes>
    <edges>
        <edge type="child" from="gnx" to="gnx"</edge>
        ...
    </edges>
    </graph>
    </leo_file>

<attr> elements
===============

<attr> elements will one of the following forms::

    <attr key="a">a unicode string</attr>
    <attr key="b" format="json">a json string</attr>
    <attr key="c" format="pickle">a json string</attr>
    <attr key="d" format="binhex">a binhexed string</attr>
    
That is, the value will be a string by default.

uA's that start with "binhex_" will use the binhex format. This
prefix must be retained in the type field, so the read code can
restore them.

If the value is not a string, and there is no "binhex_" prefix,
the write code will use format="json" if json.dumps succeeds, and
will use format="pickle" otherwise.

No <attr> element will be written if both json.dumps and
pickle.dumps fail. Attribute failures will create a warning for
the plugin developer.

<edge> elements
===============

<edge> elements will have the form::

    <edge type="child" from="gnx" to="gnx"/>
    
Leo will use type="child" to represent Leo's official edges.
Plugins are free to define any type except "child". Examples::

    <edge type="undirected" from="gnx" to="gnx"/>
    <edge type="bidirectional" from="gnx" to="gnx"/>
    <edge type="backlink" from="gnx" to="gnx"/>
    <edge type="myPlugin" from="gnx" to="gnx"/>
    
Descendant attributes in @file trees
====================================

Descendants of @file nodes do not appear in .leo files. Thus,
important data must be stored in the so-called hidden machinery:
attributes of the @file node.

The <at-file-attributes> element may be contained in the
<node> element for @file nodes::

    <at-file-attributes>

#@+node:ekr.20110419083918.6104: *5* File format, v3 graphml
@language rest
@pagewidth 65

This draft is intended to reflect our recent discussions, with no
new invention from me. All comments and corrections welcome.

The draft is also intended to be compatible with graphml.

This draft covers only Leo's xml format, but it may be adapted
for use as a json file format.

I am willing to change "type" to "key" in <edge> elements if that
would be preferable.

Recent changes
==============

- Added <graphml> element defining the default namespace.

- Defined the leo namespace for leo-only elements.
    - Renamed <leo_file> to <leo:outline>
    - Renamed <descendant-attributes> to <leo:at-file-attributes>

- Used <leo:at-file-attributes> for marks, removing the special case.

- Enclosed <leo:descendant-attributes> in a (graphml) <data> element.

- Changed the format of the "marked" attribute to be a string-valued attribute.

First lines
===========

Leo file will start with the following::

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <?xml-stylesheet my_stylesheet?>
    <!-- Created by Leo (http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/front.html) -->
    <leo:file file_format="3"
        xmlns:leo="http://www.leo-editor.org/2011/leo"/>
    <graphml xmlns="http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/xmlns"/>
        

No session data
===============

There will be no <globals>, <preferences> or
<find_panel_settings> elements. All such "session data" will be
restored from the cache, or from defaults if caching is disabled.

**Important**: there is no representation of expansion state or
the currently selected node anywhere in the .leo file.
Eliminating these data is contingent on having Leo work well with
caching disabled.

Note: marks are more than session data. They must appear
somewhere within <node> elements.


Summary of format
=================

.leo files will have the following form, with similar indentation::

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <?xml-stylesheet my_stylesheet?>
    <!-- Created by Leo (http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/front.html) -->
    <leo:outline file_format="3" xmlns:leo="http://www.leo-editor.org/2011/leo"/>
    <graphml xmlns="http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/xmlns"/>
    <graph>
    <nodes>
        <!-- marked attribute appears only if the vnode is marked -->
        <node id="gnx"> 
            <head>headline text</head>
            <attr key="marked">1</attr>
            <!-- uA's... -->
            <!-- format="string" is the default -->
            <attr key="a">a string</attr>
            <attr key="b" format="json">a json string</attr>
            <attr key="c" format="pickle">a pickled string</attr>
            <attr key="d" format="binhex">a binhexed string</attr>
            ...
            <body>body text</body>
        </node>
        ...
        <!-- @file nodes contain a <data> package -->
        <node id="gnx">
            <head>@file x.py</head>
            ...
            <data>
                <leo:at-file-attributes>
                    <attr>key="ua-name"
                        format="(empty)/json/pickle/binhex"
                        gnx="gnx">value
                    </attr>
                    ...
                </leo:at-file-attributes>
            </data>
        </node>
        ...
    </nodes>
    <edges>
        <edge type="child" from="gnx" to="gnx"</edge>
        ...
    </edges>
    </graph>
    </graphml>
    </leo:outline>

<attr> elements
===============

<attr> elements will one of the following forms::

    <attr key="a">a unicode string</attr>
    <attr key="b" format="json">a json string</attr>
    <attr key="c" format="pickle">a json string</attr>
    <attr key="d" format="binhex">a binhexed string</attr>
    
That is, the value will be a string by default.

uA's that start with "binhex_" will use the binhex format. This
prefix must be retained in the type field, so the read code can
restore them.

If the value is not a string, and there is no "binhex_" prefix,
the write code will use format="json" if json.dumps succeeds, and
will use format="pickle" otherwise.

No <attr> element will be written if both json.dumps and
pickle.dumps fail. Attribute failures will create a warning for
the plugin developer.

<edge> elements
===============

<edge> elements will have the form::

    <edge type="child" from="gnx" to="gnx"/>
    
Leo will use type="child" to represent Leo's official edges.
Plugins are free to define any type except "child". Examples::

    <edge type="undirected" from="gnx" to="gnx"/>
    <edge type="bidirectional" from="gnx" to="gnx"/>
    <edge type="backlink" from="gnx" to="gnx"/>
    <edge type="myPlugin" from="gnx" to="gnx"/>
    
Descendant attributes in @file trees
====================================

Descendants of @file nodes do not appear in .leo files. Thus,
important data must be stored in the so-called hidden machinery:
attributes of the @file node.

The <leo:at-file-attributes> element may be contained in the
<node> element for @file nodes. For compatibility with graphml,
it will enclosed in a data element::
    
    <data>
        <leo:at-file-attributes>
            <attr>key="ua-name"
                format="(empty)/json/pickle/binhex"
                gnx="gnx">value
            </attr>
            ...
        </leo:at-file-attributes>
    </data>
    
In other words, we use the graphml <attr> element, extended with the
gnx attribute, to represent all the uA's in the descendants of @file nodes.

It requires a translation layer, either to (un)munge the name or
(un)pickle. Real problem?

Let's say each time I think 'I can use UAs to store that' I change
my mind when I realize my values will be in a pickle. (I really don't
want to name all my attributes str_xxx)

How is it done in any other XML file?
I've not used XML for arbitrary data, but it probably can be done.

> Why would that way be better than pickle?

My suspicion is that UAs would be used more for
storing text and numbers (as seems common for XML files)
than Python data objects.

Does Leo use UAs to store pickles?

I'm sure pickling capability is great, but I'm not convinced
it should be the _default._

No big deal.

- Add support for the following options:

    - ignore_noweb definitions: default False for compatibility.

- When expand_noweb_references is True, definitions (typically clones)

The improved Execute Script command does most of this

Michael Manti

P.S. I think a feature that could make Leo *the* IDE for developing in 
interpreted languages is something like the (X)Emacs comint-mode.el for 
interacting with the shell and interpreters.

comint-mode.el serves as the basis for interactive modes for a number of
languages--OCaml, Haskell, SML, among them. It allows for editing expressions in
one buffer and triggering their evaluation in another buffer that has an
interpreter running in it, along with entering commands in the interpreter
buffer and moving back and forth through the history of their evaluation.

Imagine being able to highlight a node in Leo, and have all the code in it and
its children evaluated in an interpreter running in a separate window or pane,
much as Leo can open a Python shell now. Users of those languages could build
plug-ins specific to their language atop that layer, and the @language directive
could activate that. I think that would be very cool.
#@+node:ekr.20071004120359.2: *5* expand-region-abbrev
See: regionalExpandAbbrev.

You may wish to expand an abbrev with a prefix attached; for example, if `cnst'
expands into `construction', you might want to use it to enter `reconstruction'.
It does not work to type recnst, because that is not necessarily a defined
abbrev. What you can do is use the command M-' (abbrev-prefix-mark) in between
the prefix `re' and the abbrev `cnst'. First, insert `re'. Then type M-'; this
inserts a hyphen in the buffer to indicate that it has done its work. Then
insert the abbrev `cnst'; the buffer now contains `re-cnst'. Now insert a
non-word character to expand the abbrev `cnst' into `construction'. This
expansion step also deletes the hyphen that indicated M-' had been used. The
result is the desired `reconstruction'.

If you actually want the text of the abbrev in the buffer, rather than its
expansion, you can accomplish this by inserting the following punctuation with
C-q. Thus, foo C-q , leaves `foo,' in the buffer.

One feature I have not seen in SCS system is something which might be called

http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3578252
By: bwmulder

I have been thinking for a while that it ought to be possible to somehow  to
unite Leo with wiki features (my thinking is still vague at this point).

If you look at systems like Tiddlywiki (http://www.tiddlywiki.com/) you will
find that they already pretty much provide all the formatting features mentioned
in the article.

MoinMoin, another wiki (http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de), has started to use
a graphical interface for editing in the latest version.

Maybe Leo can be split up into three components:

1. A storage component is responsible for storing nodes. Currently, this is
just memory, but databases like shelve, Zope or sqllite should also be possible.

2. The control component is responsible for converting from the internal format
to external files which can be processed by existing compilers, searching within
a document, and the like.

3. A display component is responsible for interfacing with the user. If can
be TK, but it can also be something like the Tiddlywiki interface, which immediately
shows the formatting applied to text.

I don't know much about javascript, so I would have to learn more about this
language before doing anything in this direction.

As an intermediate step, maybe we could allow mixing RST processing with regular
program text.  Leo would produce two documents out of a source file: a version
for the compiler in plain ascii, and an HTML file for reading the source.
