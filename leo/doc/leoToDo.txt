1. Newbies can install Leo without problems.
2. Newbies can learn Leo's main features easily.
3. *Good* documentation exists for all importatant plugins and features.
4. Future project leaders (FPL's) know how to change Leo like I do.
    - Secondary: FPL's have the same general knowledge about Leo that I do.
5. Fix important bugs.

as noted in the other thread, you've stumbled over an omission in the docs. Here is the manual recipe for benefit of the thread archives:
Installing Leo on Windows

    Install Python from http://www.python.org/download/releases/

    Install either Tk or Qt, as described above.

    Install Leo. Get Leo’s .zip file from http://sourceforge.net/projects/leo/ You can unpack the .zip file anywhere, including Python’s site-packages folder, for example, C:\Python26\Lib\site-packages

    [optional] Generate/update a junction link from unpacked leo folder to ...\site-packages\leo:

    cd C:\Python26\Lib\site-packages\
    junction leo leo-4-6-2-final

    Create windows shortcut (edit paths as necessary):

    Target   =  C:\Python26\pythonw.exe "C:\Python26\Lib\site-packages\leo\launchLeo.py"
    Start in =  D:\code

    Associate .leo filetype batch file:

    ftype LeoFile=C:\Python26\pythonw.exe "C:\Python26\Lib\site-packages\leo\launchLeo.py" "%*"
    assoc .leo=LeoFile

    [optional] Put this leo.bat in %PATH%:

    @C:\Python26\python.exe "C:\Python26\Lib\site-packages\leo\launchLeo.py" %*

For more details, see:

See commit log for details.

The "register-leo.leos" leo script is the least tested part and should be r=
eviewed most closely. If it works widely, it obviates the need for "create-=
leobat.bat ... register" to register file type, and consolidates setting th=

Go ahead.  The script will be a starting point.  Not sure what I think
about .leos (Leo script) file extension: it's just a .py file.

I used python xy before. After I finish install python xy, the leo is ready

Today I try EPD(https://www.enthought.com/downloads/), and install pyqt4 at
its package manager.

After that, I try to start Leo, it fails, but I success at last.

the batch file should be:

Those instructions are sitll more or less relevant, but somehow all the
slashes are missing. In any case, please try downloading
"create-leobat.bat" batch file to the Leo directory and running from an
admin-level command prompt:

   create-leobat c:\\path\\to\\python27\\python.exe register

I wrote a leo script that creates the file association, which I hope to
include in the next release or on the Leo blog as a sample:
https://groups.google.com/d/msg/leo-editor/ANPuhuEIU9c/GTcpLvVB_WoJ.

To use it, copy everything between the triple curly braces {{{...}}}, but
not including the braces, and paste into an Leo window, then press [Ctrl-B]=
.

It requires that Leo is started from an Admin level command shell (or that
UAC is turned off).

From: Nick_H <nah@plextek.co.uk>

Sorry, this is probably a foolish question, but when I double-click on
any Leo file on my desktop to launch Leo, it simply launches with the
default workbook.leo file open.
I can, of course, open any file via the File|Open dialog, but that's
not so convenient.
The file association contains the following command to execute for the
Open operation:
"C:\\Tools\\Python32\\python.exe" "C:\\Tools\\Leo-4.10-final\\launchLeo.py
%*"

Can you suggest what might be wrong?
Thank you!

Good catch.  I think rather than updating this for every release, I'll
try to generalize it a bit so people will understand what is intended.
 The fix will probably be tricky: it's so hard to be clear and general
at the same time.  Otoh, making instructions
Python-and-Leo-version-depenedent is pretty hopeless.

it's the trailing %*, use "%1" instead.

You want %*  in a batch file. It passes all command line arguments to
the program being called.

"%1" passes just the file being clicked on, quoted for spaces etc.
When in a batch file %1 passes just the first command line parameter.

It is logical to expect %* to work for click file association as well,
but it doesn't. I don't know why.

Many thanks to all for these replies!
This is my final "open" string in the Windows file associations:
"C:\\Tools\\Python32\\python.exe" "C:\\Tools\\Leo-4.10-final\\launchLeo.py"
--gui=3Dqttabs "%1"
Note that the brackets are needed round the %1 to cater for file paths
containing spaces.

Matt, thanks for the extra details about using ftype and assoc. I hadn't
realised those existed in Windows. For anyone else reading this, that is an=

alternative to working through the file associations GUI.

Yes, many cool tools like this use autohotkey, or a certain compiler that 
also gets used for some malware and triggers false positives for some of 
the sloppier a/v packages.

The last set of double quotes looks wrong.  Try:

"C:\\Tools\\Python32\\python.exe" "C:\\Tools\\Leo-4.10-final\\launchLeo.py" %*

In this case, none of the double quotes are needed, because the paths
have no embedded blanks, so this also should work:

C:\\Tools\\Python32\\python.exe C:\\Tools\\Leo-4.10-final\\launchLeo.py %*

Finally, unless you have a strong reason not to do so, I would suggest
adding the --gui=qttabs option::

C:\\Tools\\Python32\\python.exe C:\\Tools\\Leo-4.10-final\\launchLeo.py
--gui=qttabs %*

This is a bit OT, but: for those like me who work in "portable" mode, 
there's a very cool tool called "PortableFileAssociator" that allows you to 
create a set of windows file associations, icons etc and enable/disable the 
whole profile at one time, without messing with the local system's registry.

Also handy for those not in portable mode, but working on different windows 
boxes and bored with having to tweak each one separately.

Excellent!  Thanks very much Matt (and Ville for creating it).
There was one error message about a signature that could not be verified, 
and a syntax error while compiling
   /usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/leo/external/edb.py
but they haven't stopped leo from opening files from my previous computer.
The new one is running precise, in case it matters.

Minor supplementary question:  What search strategy would have led me there

Installation issues typically get left until very late in the release 
cycle.  This is a mistake.

For Leo 4.11 the alpha series will be devoted to installation issues, in 
this priority:

1. Creating a single-click installer that will install everything needed, 
especially on Windows.  This already exists; it may need further testing 
and polishing.

2. Installation docs & scripts.

3. Everything else related to installation, including fixing the bugs Leo's 
traditional installer.

I'd like to get 4.11a1 out the door in the next week or so.

Your comments, please.

From: Matt Wilkie <maphew@gmail.com>

--089e016282b8b94cb204dc54300f


Hi Folks,

The leo script below _almost_ adds an icon to .leo files in Windows. I say
almost in that on my system it runs without error, the associated registry
key is created and contains the right path, but Windows still doesn't know
what to do with the file.

It's intended to be run after "create-leobat" has been run and the Leo.File
filetype is already present.

Anyone else have some ideas how to improve it?

thanks!

.. @+node:ekr.20130806072439.20669: *4* Leo script to register .leo files with Windows
From: Matt Wilkie <maphew@gmail.com>

--089e0162830c15bf5304dc597379


http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maphew/leo-editor/pypi-packaging/view/head:/register-leo.leos

QQQQ
Tell Windows how to handle .leo files, enables double clicking on them to
open.

To run: in Leo make this the active node and press [Ctrl-B] (execute-script)

Requires elevated User Account Control (UAC) privileges.
QQQQ

It is only lightly tested (one machine), but it seems to work. If
successful, it takes over the need for the assoc and ftype commands and
batch files which have been bobbing about lately (mostly be myself
admittedly).

It's stored in an @file instead of .leo in order to make it easier to track
in bazaar. Is there a naming convention for leo script files? I used .leos
for "leo script", but it occurs to me that .leox might be better (leo
executable) as it sidesteps the inadvertent pluralizing association.

feedback welcome,

-matt

Here is a Leo script which attempts to tell Windows how to handle .leo
files, enabling 2x-click "some-workbook.leo" to start. On win7+ it requires
Leo be started with elevated admin privileges.

@nocolor

From: "Edward K. Ream" <edreamleo@gmail.com>




I spent some time experimenting with html-formatted help commands.  I 
quickly came to the conclusion that this was a bad idea: using <pre> will 
not look good enough, and it is out of the question to hand-format docs 
twice.

Instead, Leo will load docutils from leo/extensions if an initial import of 
docutils fails.  That way, newbies will see the best-possible help 
commands, without having to explicitly install docutils. I'll soon be 
upping new code with fallback imports using g.importExtension.

There seems to be a problem with docutils on Windows with Python 3.x.  The 
docutils docs say that 2to3 is run "on demand", but that doesn't appear to 
be working.  Happily, it took just a few seconds to run 2to3 on the 
docutils-0.10/build folder, and a few more seconds to copy that to my 
Python 3.3 folder.  This is, iirc, the *first* time I have ever 
successfully run docutils with Python 3.x.

In short, distributing a fallback copy of docutils with Leo makes sense to 
me.  It eliminates dual documentation, and should ensure that all Leo 
newbies will see good-looking docs.  The downside is that the docutils 
folder is about 2.7 meg.

Your comments, please.

I have no time to read through this thread now, but- why is this in
"extensions" instead of "external"?

The take away is that there is a pure python method to install pip, which
in turn can easily install Leo and docutils, meaning the two don't have to
be bundled.

There is still more work to do get PyQt + SIP install automated in a way
that integrates nicely with Start Menu etc., but we have proof of concept
that it is possible.

At the very least we have a recipe that can easily build a complete ready
to run all-in-one zip bundle for Windows. I'll work on this next, and then
dig more into the pyqt+sip aspect.

There might be a way to distribute the folder as a .zip, but probably
not worth it, seeing the whole distribution will be a .zip or some
other compressed format most likely.

This is probably the best solution - no double authoring and proper
formatting everywhere.

So... shall we put Qt in a folder ... :-)

Installing pip on Windows is easy enough, but involves silly monkey work 
(install this pre-requiste, copy this text and paste it there, twiddling 
X,Y,Z for your machine. etc.) It's easy to make small stupid mistakes that 
make one have to repeat parts of the operation. So I automated installing 
pip all in one go. Nothing but an available python interpreter is required 
(and an internet connection).

http://www.maphew.com/2013/install-pip-script/

It's not smart, but it works, and that will do for me until someone builds 
a better one. ;-)

Thanks for this.  I'm getting quite adept at installing docutils by hand, 
but I don't understand your recipe, or how it could be wrapped.

It would be great you or someone else could automate the process of 
installing dependencies.

_This doesn't help newbies and isn't directly useful to the topic at hand,
but is grist for the mill in the larger long term "making Leo easier to
install" project._

Here is a recipe using the pip python installer, that adds docutils to
python 3 in about 5 minutes. Ideally the same template/process would be
extended for all of Leo, and wrapped up in a nice package.

There are lots of scary looking warnings and messages emitted to the
console, mostly about unicode and files looked for and not found. A couple
of places I needed to tap [enter] (with no prompt saying that was
necessary). At the "install docutils" stage there was a long pause with
nothing apparent happening, perhaps 3 minutes.

The command shell was a generic windows cmd.exe shell with no python
variables set (e.g. PYTHONPATH, PYTHONHOME, etc.)

This is turning into quite a project.  The present trunk code suffices to 
print the F1 message, and other help messages, but the code fails *many* 
unit tests.  This is not a proper long-term solution.  Instead, I must 
begin the port afresh and use a more automated approach.

My initial porting efforts were useful.  I've learned about docutils, its 
unit tests, and also 2to3.  I've even written a prototype for an enhanced 
--fix=imports fixer that will add *both* python 2 and 3 imports.  This 
could be a crucial part of creating a unified code base.

Unicode handling is a vital part of docutils, as I discovered as I watched 
many of docutils 1200+ unit tests failing :-)  Alas, a vital unicode 
consistency check in docutils/utils/punctuation_chars.py fails on Windows.  
I've just asked the docutils-dev group about this.  See: 
http://news.gmane.org/gmane.text.docutils.devel

Interesting.  I've filed this under Leo/Do Later, just to have some place
to put it, but I'd like to encourage you to contribute a script, if you
haven't already done so :-)

Hello Folks,

Can someone on linux please test whether

   pip install -i https://testpypi.python.org/pypi leo-editor

successfully installs a working Leo on their system?

You can use `virtualenv` to create an isolated test environment

seemed to work for my in a fresh python 3.3 virtualenv

i.e.
import leo
leo.run()
ImportError: No module named 'PyQt4'

so in the shell

cp -rv /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/PyQt4 p3/lib/python3.3/site-packages/
cp -rv /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/sip* p3/lib/python3.3/site-packages/

and then the above worked.

including HansBKK's good point.

.. @+node:ekr.20130806072439.20686: *4* Mac OS Lion installation instructions need updating
From: "kevin@ksvanhorn.com" <kvanhorn@ksvanhorn.com>

The instructions for installing Leo on Mac OS X 10.7 Lion say to run

/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/gist/323731)"

Actually, that doesn't work. If you run the curl command by itself,
you get a message that the script has moved to

https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Contributions/install_homebrew.rb

That actually gives you a web page instead of the script itself. I
ended up doing a copy and paste from the script shown on that page
into a newly created file, then running the script.

Thanks for this detailed report.  I'll look into it soon.

From: "JohnKStevenson@gmail.com" <john.k.stevenson@gmail.com>

Here is the question I posed and then sent to a user rather than the
qroup:

The instructions at Ed Ream's site, say to use brew to load pyqt and
sip, actually they don't say to load sip.

Why would the order be important? Are they not individual packages?

After failing to get it to run following the instructions,
I loaded QT from Troll Tech and it still failed.

My system:
 Xcode 3.2.6
 Python 2.6.1 is installed.
 gcc 4.2.1  is installed.
 QT installed under Developer/Tools and Developer/Applications
-- Clean /usr/local
-- chown -R me:admin /usr/local
-- Install homebrew

---  /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/gist/323731)"

Brew 0.9 is installed.
---       brew update

-- Install PyQT
--- brew install pyqt
pyqt-4.9.1 installed
---  brew install sip
sip-4.13.2 installed
--  Added to path, (.bash_profile)
 --- export $PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python:$PYTHONPATH

-- unzipped leo-4.10 somewhere
-- ran the script element "python launchLeo.py --gui=qt $1" result:
"no such option --qt"

I really wish there were a simple script or brew thing to load this
tool.

It seems that most "Leo People" are using Windoze or Linux, but Mac
people need good outlining too. (Bring in the CLONES!)

David Humphrey responded, thanks David, but still no joy.

Thanks in advance for any advice....

From: David Humphrey <david@dlkeh.net>

John,

I'm definitely not a Qt specialist (or Leo specialist either), but I
wonder if your PyQt installation is working correctly.  Try importing
PyQt4 as Leo does and see if any error messages appear.  Here's how it
looked on my machine:

Deviant:~ dlh$ python
Python 2.7.2 (v2.7.2:8527427914a2, Jun 11 2011, 15:22:34)
[GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5666) (dot 3)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import PyQt4.QtCore
>>> import PyQt4.QtGUI
>>>

i.e., clean imports, no complaints.  While this will only provide
clues, they might be enough to help move forward.

I find this same lack of support with other apps, e.g, Wikidpad, but,
let's face it: There are a lot more Windows and Linux boxes running
these non-commercial apps than OS X boxes.

Regards,
DLH

Hi John, =20

I wrote the original instructions for using Homebrew to install Leo on the =
Mac. Unfortunately those instructions are a bit outdated by now. From your =
description I only see one problem: the PYTHONPATH you added to .bash_profi=
le has changed to

export PYTHONPATH=3D/usr/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH

This is mentioned by brew after you install sip - reinstall sip to verify t=
he correct incantation for you (I assume you are using Python 2.6 - change =
to python2.7 if necessary).

To answer some of your questions: pyqt depends on qt and sip, therefore ins=
talling the pyqt package will automatically install the rest. I've installe=
d them separately in the instructions below to pick up the correct PYTHONPA=
TH setting.

Here is a summary of what I did today on a reasonably clean Lion system to =
get Leo working (maybe Ed can put this on the web site):

- Read the Homebrew installation instructions at
  https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/Installation

- Make sure you have Xcode installed (test it by confirming
  that "gcc" runs in the Terminal). You can either get the full
  Xcode beast or the lean-and-mean Command-Line Tools
  for Xcode, as suggested in the Homebrew installation
  instructions.


- In preparation for Homebrew, the best option in my opinion is
  to delete /usr/local via::

  sudo rm -rf /usr/local

  and install any software in it via Homebrew instead. If this step
  fills you with dread and you do not want to lose your beloved
  third-party software, the second-best option is to make sure you
  have write permission for the directory via::

  sudo chown -R <your user name>:admin /usr/local

  If you don't know your username, run "whoami". :-) This is
  useful because homebrew actually discourages you from
  installing third-party software as the superuser (the usual Mac
  apps in /Applications are also installed as the normal user,
  for that matter).


- Install Homebrew (http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) by running
the following command in the Terminal::


  /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(/usr/bin/curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homeb=
rew/master/Library/Contributions/install_homebrew.rb)"

- Run "brew doctor" and check any further suggestions to improve
your system.


- Run "brew update" to get the latest formulas

- Install sip and note the caveat::

  brew install sip

  This warns you to add the local python directory to your PYTHONPATH.
  Make a note of what this is (especially if you are not on Lion!).

- Add the following lines to your ~/.bash_profile
  (or ~/.profile on Leopard) - this is the default for LION::

  export PATH=3D/usr/local/bin:$PATH
  # This is for SIP (and PyQT) as suggested by Homebrew
  export PYTHONPATH=3D/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH

- Install PyQT::

  brew install pyqt
 =20

- Open a new Terminal tab / window so that the above settings
  take effect, and install Leo. I downloaded the Leo-4.9-final-a.zip,
  unzipped it, and ran "python launchLeo.py" inside the Leo
  directory.


It would really be great to get a Leo formula going for Homebrew=85 As ment=
ioned before, the main question is just where to place all the Leo files in=
 the /usr/local hierarchy.

Regards,
Ludwig

From: "JohnKStevenson@gmail.com" <john.k.stevenson@gmail.com>

Many thanks to Ludwig Schwardt, he identified the missing element of
the $PYTHONPATH, for Snow Leopard it is "export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/
lib/python2.6/site-packages" . Since I had an incorrect pythonpath, I
just set it. Once set, leo works.
It would be nice to have a script to install Leo.
The directory structure and placement should be the same as Linux?

I have not used Leo for a number of years, so this is a good reunion,
thanks all.

From: Sheng <jmmxwll@gmail.com>




Hello,
I recently discovered Leo in my search for an editor or IDE for python 
programming -- I'm a beginner but am working on a larger project and trying 
out a modular approach requiring organisation of lots of files. Leo would 
be an attractive option if not for various obstacles, including among 
others the following:

  1. Doesn't automatically open previously loaded workbooks, or by file 
click
     * Even when file directly clicked, doesn't open.
     * Only opens from File menu. Annoying & inconvenient. 
  2. Same file as node opened in notepad then edited while still open in 
Leo doesn't update, even on refresh.
  3. Does not open python files in Idle with selection of menu item: File 
--> Open With --> Idle
  
I'm on Windows 8. I've already spent several hours solving other problems 
and reading Leo documentation. Any links or tips to overcome these problems 
quickly would be appreciated.

Sheng.

You've found a bug that only affects new users, and I just learned about
today:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/leo-editor/+bug/971171

QQQQ

Work Around:
With Leo-Editor not running, create a zero length file
$(HOME)/.leo/.leoRecentFiles.txt.

This is tricky under Windows because File Explorer does NOT let you enter a
file name that begins with a period. You can get around it by using the
command line and standard-out redirection:

echo >.leoRecentFiles.txt

The easiest way to set up file associations in Windows is to use Matt's 
script, mentioned in that thread.  If you're on a Windows XP box, you 
may like to look at my modified copy instead 
(https://gist.github.com/gatesphere/4692706). If you're on a linux or 
Mac machine, then the steps differ... I forget how I set up file 
associations on my Linux Mint box, but it was less than friendly, and 
every linux desktop environment has a slightly different way of handling 
things.

    The easiest way to set up file associations in Windows is to use
    Matt's script, mentioned in that thread.&nbsp; If you're on a Windows XP
    box, you may like to look at my modified copy instead (<a
      href="https://gist.github.com/gatesphere/4692706">https://gist.github.com/gatesphere/4692706</a>).&nbsp;
    If you're on a linux or Mac machine, then the steps differ... I
    forget how I set up file associations on my Linux Mint box, but it
    was less than friendly, and every linux desktop environment has a
    slightly different way of handling things.<br>

File -> Recent does not show my most recently opened Leo files, even though

You must set the file association manually, at present.  Getting this to
happen automatically is a top priority.

Hmm.  It seems like setting file associations isn't documented anywhere.
That's a major hole.

We are currently discussing this topic in this thread:
Bat file launchers for nightly builds:
https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/leo-editor/li9ILUWuNAs
Anyone want to summarize the results?

The vim and xemacs plugins do an automatic refresh.  It won't be possible
to update Leo automagically from scite until you save the file in site.
This could be called a bug: please feel free to file a bug report.

OpenWith:Idle opens a Leo *node*, not a file.  However, you could use @edit
to put an entire file into a node, and then open the @edit node with Idle.

I personally never use Idle, which is probably why OpenWith:Idle isn't very
useful.  Instead, I use g.pdb.

Thanks for your comments.  Please feel free to continue this conversation.

This is good feedback, thanks for taking the time to share your experience.

  2. Same file as node opened in notepad then edited while still open in
> Leo doesn't update, even on refresh.

Unless opened with the right-click context menu "Edit in..." Leo doesn't
automatically notice changes made outside it's environment. For external
file nodes (@auto, @edit, @file, etc.) use the right-click context menu
"Refresh from disk". (There will be an equivalent [Alt-X] minibuffer
command but I don't know what it is.)

I know it's confusing, but the right-click "Edit in..." is different from
"File > Open with" and a point of current debate,

This menu command looks for "%PYTHONHOME%/Lib/idlelib/idle.pyw" (see
leoSettings.leo >> @settings >> Menu >> Open with menu).  If that's not
defined or in a different location it will fail, perhaps without emitting a
visible error. This combined with the fact that your Recent Files menu is
not keeping it's history make me think there's something broken in your
install.

Here is a summary from the other thread.  To repeat, the goal is to
automate as much of this as possible for Leo 4.11a1

QQQQQ
Installing Leo on Windows

   1.

   Install Python from http://www.python.org/download/releases/
   2.

   Install either Tk or Qt, as described above.
   3.

   Install Leo. Get Leo=E2=80=99s .zip file from
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/leo/ You can unpack the .zip file
   anywhere, including Python=E2=80=99s *site-packages* folder, for example=
,
   C:\\Python26\\Lib\\site-packages
   4.

   [optional] Generate/update a junction link from unpacked leo folder to
   ...\\site-packages\\leo:

   cd C:\\Python26\\Lib\\site-packages\\
   junction leo leo-4-6-2-final

    5.

   Create windows shortcut (edit paths as necessary):

   Target   =3D  C:\\Python26\\pythonw.exe
"C:\\Python26\\Lib\\site-packages\\leo\\launchLeo.py"
   Start in =3D  D:\\code

    6.

   Associate .leo filetype batch file:

   ftype LeoFile=3DC:\\Python26\\pythonw.exe
"C:\\Python26\\Lib\\site-packages\\leo\\launchLeo.py" "%*"
   assoc .leo=3DLeoFile

    7.

   [optional] Put this leo.bat in %PATH%:

   @C:\\Python26\\python.exe "C:\\Python26\\Lib\\site-packages\\leo\\launchLeo.py"=
 %*

Thanks. 

Re:

@edit to put an entire file into a node, and then open the @edit node with 
Idle.

Sorry, I meant python file, which is set as a node in Leo. Nothing opens in 
Idle. Idle does not open at all on selection of this option. I just want a 
quick way to run my __init__.py file, a node. At present I have to open it 
from the Idle menu. Or more conveniently, I use Eclipse -- but I want to 
give Leo a go, which is why I'm here.

Re:

> I personally never use Idle, which is probably why OpenWith:Idle isn't

Is that a function on Leo? Maybe something I should look into.

> Thanks for your comments.  Please feel free to continue this conversation.

You're welcome. I was hoping they'd be taken not just as complaints, but 
things which a newcomer to Leo is likely to encounter, likely to put off 
other potential users, which should be fixed if it's a goal for Leo to gain 
wider adoption. But I understand that development resources are limited, 
and this may not be a priority.

I was wrong:

"Open with" *will* bring the changes from external editors back in to Leo,
but only if the context_menu plugin is enabled. It usually is by default,
see leoSettings.leo >> @enabled_plugins (and the bug report linked to).

File -> Recent is your friend. I always use it to get back to old files,
and use File -> Open only once in a blue moon.

.. @+node:ekr.20130806072439.20707: *4* Portable Leo from scratch on Windows
From: Matt Wilkie <maphew@gmail.com>

--001a11c29c60626ff804da92ec5a


Here is a recipe for installing Leo from scratch on Windows (Win7 tested).
The only prerequisites are command line `wget` in PATH and an internet
connection.

About 50mb of files are downloaded and 200mb consumed when done.

Open a command prompt and run:

{{{
mkdir X:\\testing
pushd X:\\testing

wget -O apt.exe --no-clobber
http://download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/release/apt/apt-r1193M.exe
SET OSGEO4W_ROOT=%~dp0\\root
apt setup
apt update
apt install pyqt4 sip

call root\\osgeo4w.bat

wget --no-check-certificate
http://gist.github.com/maphew/5393935/raw/install-pip.py
python install-pip.py GO
python install-pip.py GO

pip install -i https://testpypi.python.org/pypi leo-editor

python apps\\Python27\\Scripts\\leo
}}}

After this the directory "X:\\testing\\root" can be renamed and/or moved
anywhere.

To run leo in future sessions, simply call "x:\\path\\to\\root\\osgeo4w.bat
python apps\\Python27\\Scripts\\leo", either as a batch file or windows
shortcut.

IMPORTANT NOTE - this is just a proof of concept. It pulls together a
couple of my different projects, and is very satisfying in that regard
(yay! they work!), but is not ready for prime time. Feedback welcome.

Explanations will follow in later messages. I just had to share this
important milestone immediately. :-)

From: HaveF <iamaplayer@gmail.com>

When execute Leo.bat on winxp, it says,
"The system cannot execute the specified program"

Just  add some echo to OSGeo4W.bat, the problem seems at this line:

    for %%f in ("%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\\etc\\ini\\*.bat") do call "%%f"

By quick search this error message, I found
http://nirlevy.blogspot.com/2008/03/system-cannot-execute-specified-program.html
does some dll files are only used for win7?

>SET OSGEO4W_ROOT=%~dp0\\root

Use the `apt` command line package management tool from Osgeo4w [1] to
install python and all the other requirements that can't be installed with
`pip` or `easy_install`, meaning PyQt and SIP.

The resultant dir structure follows a cygwin model, which in turn follows
linux:

...\\apps\\Python27 - python libraries, site-packages, etc. This is
PYTHONHOME.

..\\bin - exe's and dll's, including python.exe, qt*.dll, etc.

There are also `etc, include, lib, var` which can all be discarded, unless
you intend to use apt again or other programs from the osgeo4w ecosystem).
`var` in particular you might want to clean out, it is the local cache for
apt downloaded packages.

[1] http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/ Open Source Geographic Information
Systems for Windows

...more to come.

That's great. I'll test it on my virtualbox winxp later.
Btw, I strongly suggest add this recipe and this link to leo's doc.

There are so much of recipes(like pearls) bury under googlegroups instead
of doc for permanent saving.

Adds ...\\bin (for python) and ...\\apps\\python27\\scripts (for pip) to PATH,
and sets PYTHONHOME.

Download and install `distribute` and `pip`, the python tools which enable
automated downloading and installing of programs and modules from the
Python Package Index. `install-pip.py` is of my own devising. All it does
is reduce the dependency on curl or wget by one step, using native urlib
(py3) or urllib2 (py2) instead.

   http://pythonhosted.org/distribute/
   http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/
   https://pypi.python.org/pypi

>pip install -i https://testpypi.python.org/pypi leo-editor

Install Leo (more background for this one in next message).

> python apps\\Python27\\Scripts\\leo

All done, let's run Leo! :)

Ok, looking forward to reviewing it. Making leo installable with pip
certainly sounds attractive.

Edward, Ville, please pay attention to this message even if just nodding at
the others passing by.

>pip install -i https://testpypi.python.org/pypi leo-editor
>

I built and uploaded to this package to the pypi testing server. Other than
the fact it seems to work in so far as it installs without spewing errors
I've no idea if it was done properly. Or even if it was appropriate for me
to build a leo package. This is the first pypi package I've built.

The package page: https://testpypi.python.org/pypi/leo-editor/4.10-final

I'll upload the changed `setup.py` and the build recipe I used for your
inspection after I re-learn how to create a branch and issue a pull/merge
request in bazaar.

best regards,

-matt

> "The system cannot execute the specified program"

ugh. I think maybe the previous link you referred to is correct, and there
are either some .dll's missing or incompatible, which in turn means this
isn't really a great leap forward after all. :(

Thanks for testing and the follow up.

> Btw, why you all use three {{{ or }}} to quote the code?

Triple curly bracket {{{...}}}  is used by MoinMoin wiki to mark verbatim
<http://moinmo.in/HelpOnMoinWikiSyntax#Verbatim_Display>blocks. You might
also run into tilde, ~~~, or backtick, ```, used to fence code in other
markup parsers, like
markdown-extra<http://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/#fenced-code-blocks>.
I don't have any particular reason for using moinmoin syntax, other than I
got used to it first. ;-)

Does this leo.bat work better?

{{{
setlocal
set PYTHONHOME=%~dp0\\root\\apps\\Python27
set PATH=%~dp0\\root\\bin
%~dp0\\root\\bin\\python.exe %PYTHONHOME%\\Scripts\\leo
endlocal
pause
}}}

If not please send me the results of what it prints to the console window.

thanks,

same msg. "The system cannot execute the specified program"

log msg:

C:\\Leo-editor-portable>setlocal

C:\\Leo-editor-portable>set
PYTHONHOME=C:\\Leo-editor-portable\\\\root\\apps\\Python27


C:\\Leo-editor-portable>set PATH=C:\\Leo-editor-portable\\\\root\\bin

C:\\Leo-editor-portable>C:\\Leo-editor-portable\\\\root\\bin\\python.exe
C:\\Leo-editor
-portable\\\\root\\apps\\Python27\\Scripts\\leo
"The system cannot execute the specified program"

C:\\Leo-editor-portable>endlocal


Btw, why you all use three {{{ or }}} to quote the code?
It is standard or something?

It appears that since I was the first one to use the testing server for
'leo-editor' I've become the owner. If you send me your usernames I'll make

> Whoa, apt on windows, cool.

Thanks! It's been the gravity well powering my plunge into python. It's a
testament to python's power that it enables someone like me, with no
programming background, to build something that does real work. :)

The original genius is Jan Nieuwenhuizen, who wrote `cyg-apt` in python but
made lots of calls to bash and tools like tar and curl. All I've done is
take each function and convert them as best I could to pure python, to the
point where it now has zero dependencies on cygwin (though it does still
use the cygwin package and mirror structure).

.. @+node:ekr.20130806072439.20723: *4* Problem saving changes/new .leo files on Windows
From: vili <viljem.tisnikar@gmail.com>

Hi everybody,

Despite I am no programmer, I have been using Leo for some years now
as my "Intelligent PIM" - I organize my (complex) life with Leo.

Many thanks to Edward and others for the great application.

Installing (a new version) of Leo was allways a bit of challenge for
me. As a non-programmer I use Windows, I like automatic installers,
and I don=B4t quite understand what binaries and other stuff is.

Today I wanted to upgrade from 4.9 to Leo-4.10-final, which is the
latest exe on SourceForge but I figured out that

Leo-4.10-final does not save any changes made to the file and it doesn
=B4t save also any new files!

I tried also with "a nightly snapshot from Leo=92s snapshots page" - the
same story. I reinstalled python and qt, but still the same problem. I
installed back the 4.9 version from SourceForge and that worked fine
again.

Some data from log:
Leo 4.10 final, build 5020, 2012-02-26 13:18:08 -0600
Python 3.2.3, qt version 4.8.0
Windows 6, 1, 7601, 2, Service Pack 1

Its kind of weird for me that no one reported this problem earlier.

BR, Vili

Yes, I have. It does not save.

No, in log window nothing happens when I pres "ctrl-s". And of course the
star near the name of the file does not disappear.

I faced the same problem as well and my configuration is exactly
identical to yours.
Workaround I did was start the leo from command line
C:\\Python32\\python.exe "C:\\Python32\\Lib\\site-packages\\Leo-4.10-final
\\launchLeo.py"
Default is to start the pythonW.exe, which does not work for some
reason still trying to identify why it is behaving this way.
Now I am able to save like before.

Also newly added Alt+x Global-search(whoosh), was not able to do fts
add/init. however it does search the currently opened one.

Good luck with figuring out what the problem is.

To my knowledge this is the first report of this kind of issue. I
can't think of any explanation for this other than file permissions
(but I don't understand very much about how Leo works either; my
programming skills are very minimal).

Have you tried creating a new .leo file from scratch and saving it?
And does the log window have any warnings or error messages? I'm
wondering if maybe there is something in particular about your data
files it is getting confused about.

From: Matt Wilkie <maphew@gmail.com>

--001a11c26ed64e753204dd570b8b


Hi Folks,

I've just uploaded Leo-4.11-devel-build-5769 to the Python Package Index:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/leo

(todo: fix the readme, which is for 4.10, the 4.11 version remains to be
written)

It can be downloaded from there and installed manually or, better yet,
installed with `pip install leo`.

Pre-requisites are:

1. Python
2. PyQt
3. Distribute / Setuptools

Improvements over previous pypi package:

 - Sports Leo splash screen while installing on Windows

 - Installs "leo" and "leoc" wrappers to PYTHONHOME\\Scripts, so as long as
this directory is in PATH you don't need to create your own launcher (this
is the part that requires Distribute. I'm working an way to include this
automatically, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16702658). It is common
for this to be set.

- all the other changes in trunk over the last couple of weeks (
http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~leo-editor-team/leo-editor/trunk3/changes)

cheers,

-matt

Interesting.  This looks like a completely different installer than the

From: Terry Brown <terry_n_brown@yahoo.com>

Summary - it's easy to make a .zip file containing Leo and all it's
dependencies.

Inspired by Matt's recipe, using VirtualBox throw away 1GB Windows XP
32 bit machines, I tried the following.

Install Python (installer from python.org) 2.7.2 to 

  C:\\Docouments and Settings\\someuser\\Desktop\\leo\\python27

Install PyQt (installer from Riverbank) 4.9 into the same folder (it
goes there by default)

Unzip http://www.greygreen.org/leo/leo-editor-latest.zip into

  C:\\Docouments and Settings\\someuser\\Desktop\\leo\\leo-editor-latest

Make leo.zip from C:\\Docouments and Settings\\someuser\\Desktop\\leo

Delete the virtual machine, purging any registry entries etc. created
by the two installers.

On a fresh machine, searched the registry for 'python' just to be sure,
found nothing.

Unzip the .zip file, then

  cd C:\\Docouments and Settings\\someuser\\Desktop\\leo
  python27\\python.exe leo-editor-latest\\launchLeo.py

And Leo opens a blank outline, after asking for an ID, as it's supposed
to.  Didn't test it beyond that.

So, the .zip file contains all Leo needs to run, and obviously
runLeo.bat could be added in the top level to actually launch it.

Cheers -Terry

Hi,

I dont like the portable apps solution.
Thats a third party and if you have bugs there you have bugs in leo.

but a standalone no registry all in one zip sounds terrific.

I agree, I guess we're aiming at the users who move on when they see
"to install Leo, first install Python and PyQt, then..."  The question
again of whether they're going to want Leo when they have it or not.

I guess, perhaps as an all-in-one option with a system integrated
option for those who want to use system python/qt.  Don't know if it
violates and licensing on Python / Qt, everything's being distributed
unaltered, so I wouldn't think so.

So basically you'd give people a large .zip file and tell them to
extract it to a folder and run the batchfile at the top level.  If they
can't do that, they might not be ready for Leo :-)  I guess you could
make it a self-extracting .zip, for that matter.

Also, the daily snapshot could be made this way, seeing once Python and
Qt are installed in the folder the Leo version can just be copied in.

It's not uncommon for FLOSS to be distributed this way, both Blender
and Inkscape use this approach, particularly for recent builds.

Since this topical today, almost a year later, I thought I'd take a run at 
repeating this using Portable Python (http://www.portablepython.com) as a 
base. It didn't work, but I think it should. Maybe someone else knows why. 

I ran the installer for 2.7.3 since 3.2 doesn't include PyQt4. At install 
time I selected only the Python and PyQt4 packages. Then from a fresh 
command shell:
{{{
path=c:\\windows;c:\\windows\\system32
pushd x:\\portapy27\\App
path=%cd%;%cd%\\Scripts;%cd%\\Lib\\site-packages\\PyQt4;%path%
set pythonhome=%cd%
set pythonpath=%cd%\\Lib

popd

python --version
Python 2.7.3

python -c "import PyQt4"
:: no error returned, we're good.

python c:\\apps\\leo-editor-latest\\launchLeo.py
Leo requires Qt to be installed.
}}}

oh well.

My 2=A2:

If something like this **is** done, it should IMO be packaged as an=20

You would definitely get marketing exposure by getting the specs from=20
PortableApps.com and let them host it there as  "Portable Leo", tracking=20
the "official" Portable Python (currently 2.7.2) as a dependency, obviously=

including QT etc as well. But it would need to be kept up to date. . .

Most Windows users would be better served by following the normal=20

registry-and-environment-variables-complete install of Python et al which=

they can use for other things beyond Leo. Ending up with multiple instances=

What kinds of problems were you encountering?

Personally I use MacPorts for such things, which works reasonably well at the cost of building redundant versions of lots of stuff.

Two perspectives on this:

1) For me ( a long time Leo user and advocate) having an up-to-date 
PortableApps version would be FANTASTIC!! I wish I knew how to make it 
happen. I run the latest version from a DropBox folder so it's available on 
the several computers I use between work and home. However, having it 
available on a thumb drive (with all the dependencies and home environment 
set) would be even better.
2) For potential new users of Leo, I agree that an all-in-one zip file 
installation would be beneficial. I don't think it has to be too 'dumbed 
down' (though that's a relative term and I suppose I might even be in that 
category :-)

Of course this is for Windows, so I think it's an improvement over
asking people to install Python and PyQt first, but neither of those
steps was that hard in Windows anyway.  I wonder if anything similar is
possible for Mac.

Interesting.

Is this a technique that we could use for official Windows releases?
If so, what exactly would we do?

Now, since then I've seen several posts suggesting other strategies. I 
can't yet bring myself to try them, especially considering that my Mac is 
no longer in an 'original state' considering all the mucking around I did 
before (and don't know how to undo). If (and when) PyQt ever becomes 
available with prebuilt binaries for Mac platform, I'll be all over it. 
Until then, probably not.

A couple of versions have been posted here already, including Terry's very 
simple sequence in the first message of this thread. Of course, we're only 
talking about Windows, but note that it works equally well either syncing 
with whatever tool (I favor Unison over SSH) or carrying around on an 
arbitrary-path'd external device, including flash drives (but they can be 
slow).

Here's my more robust (hence more complex) version, xx indicating your 
python version (mine is 27):

Use the normal .MSI, setup.exe etc processes to Install a clean "canonical" 
version of your "python dev stack" to say C:\\PythonXX, reboot if needed, 
test thoroughly. Note any new environment variables pointing to your new 
binary locations.

Now create a corresponding PythonXX folder in your "PortableApps" location 
(I put it under "CommonFiles" along with GTK and Java) and copy everything 
from your installed location to the portable one.

You can then use the project-provided tools on the "master" computer to 
keep your binaries updated, and they will see any local Registry entries 
and the environment variables they created and operate normally wrt your 
installed location (e.g. C:\\PythonXX).

If you have a local folder sync tool (I use Unison and WinMerge) you can 
add to/remove from/configure your Python environment from either location, 
otherwise just keep your installed location as the "master" and just copy 
the whole stack over each time you do so.

The whole PortableApps tree can then be sync'd/copied to any other 
desktop(s) you like, either over the wire or via an external device, and 
the latter can be carried for use in say an Internet cafe or client-site 
situation.

====================
For use on those other computers, for running in portable mode, I use a 
"portable start menu" (PStart) which allows for its own "autolaunch" batch 
files, where I set some global environment variables to be used by 
app-specific launch batch files, including :

%Path% (I add my batch folder and a general utility/tools folder)
%HOME% (usually "E:\\aasync\\Data\\H_HOME"
and a custom one called %h_pa%, which points to the root of my PortableApps 
parent (usually "D:\\aasync\\PortableApps")

Then for each environment that requires its own custom settings, I create a 
launch batch file that builds on that base. In the case of Python apps, 
here's an example that opens a CMD console window:

@ECHO OFF
set 
PATH=%PATH%;%h_pa%\\CommonFiles\\Python27;%h_pa%\\CommonFiles\\Python27\\Lib\\site-packages\\PyQt4;%h_pa%\\CommonFiles\\Python27\\Lib\\idlelib;%h_pa%\\CommonFiles\\Python27\\Scripts;
set PROMPT=$p_python$g
E:
cd \\aasync
CMD.exe

I'm not sure which if any of the environment stuff Leo requires, but I 
figure it might as well have the same environment as my Python CLI, since 
I'll be testing shell integration, including iPython. In my leo-win.bat, 
the last three lines above are replaced with:

D:
cd \\aasync\\PortableApps\\leo-editor
start "" "..\\CommonFiles\\Python27\\pythonw.exe" 
"..\\CommonFiles\\Python27\\Lib\\site-packages\\leo-editor4\\launchLeo.py" %*

====================

Note this is more than the minimum you need to just run Leo - you could of 
course simplify it; for example, only set the environment variables Leo 
requires, or you could just set the master computer' installation routines 
to use a single location under PortableApps, but I prefer to keep them

I am now turning my attention to an important bug: 
https://bugs.launchpad.net/leo-editor/+bug/1021849
This is a top-priority bug in the distribution project.

The effect of this bug is that the desktop shortcut has an incorrect path

I am now turning my attention to an important bug: 
> https://bugs.launchpad.net/leo-editor/+bug/1021849
>

The fix is on the trunk at rev 5789.  This is a major step forward. Here is 
the checkin log::

QQQ
Fixed the icon problem and improved and simplified the install/uninstall 
process in several ways.

1. Fixed https://bugs.launchpad.net/leo-editor/+bug/1021849

The fix was to CreateShortCut in the Desktop Shortcut section:
  - remove single quotes.
  - remove the "0" trailing arg.

2. Changed the make-leo button to simplify the uninstall manifest.

Rather than computing the files to be deleted, the uninstall script now 
just does RMDir /r "$INSTDIR\\leo".
This *is* safe, and ensures that all files & directories get deleted, 
including $INSTDIR itself.
QQQ

The only possible drawback to using the /r option is that it will delete 
any files that the user has created in the leo directory.  Imo, there is no 
perfect solution to this.  Warning prompts never do any good, and if we 
retain files, for whatever reason, there will be bug reports saying that 
Leo didn't properly uninstall itself.  This has already happened :-)

I am happy to live with the present situation, unless somebody a) objects 
loudly and b) shows how the problem can be solved cleanly.

From: =?ISO-8859-1?Q?Offray_Vladimir_Luna_C=E1rdenas?= <offray@riseup.net>

I have been using txt2tags + Nested Editor to produce structured docs in 
a light markup and exporting them to HTML and LaTeX > pdf. The fine 
tunning on the pdf output is done by editing the LaTeX source in Leo. I 
like the aesthetic of the source code and the outputs and I have 
contacted the Nested author in order to get some cross-pollination 
between it and Leo [1].

[1] 
https://groups.google.com/group/nestededitor/browse_thread/thread/7068e3cd229d4614 


Now I think that is time to start hacking Leo for a better support of my 
work flow and the first thing I would like to have is a "@paragraph" 
directive that works the same as @rst-no-head but can be used in any 
part of a (sub)tree, even if is not @rst (sub)tree. This would come 
handy in chunking and reassembling LaTeX docs without marking up the 
parts with "<<chunk>>" tags. As I have say repeatedly I'm an "end user" 
of Leo and I have browse the doc about developing in Leo in [2] and I 
plan to follow it as a tutorial, but any pointer to a more detailed 
section to pay attention or to the Leo trees to start hacking is welcomed

From: "Edward K. Ream" <edreamleo@gmail.com>




The title pretty much says it all.  This is a significant improvement, and 
makes Leo suitable for authoring text.  It should have been done ages ago. 
Please let me know immediately if this new behavior causes problems for you.

There is one glitch.  If you add @wrap, the directive won't be in effect 
until you leave the node and revisit it.

There is one problem which is (IMHO) caused by this change: I have @wrap 
active and see my "plain" text wrapped properly. But if there is any "long 
enough" URL on the page (i.e. longer than the screen width), this is not 
wrapped (as there is no space in the string) nor I can see the end of it 
(as there is no horizontal scrollbar either) ;-(

Thanks for this report.  It's an interesting problem.  The workaround is to
disable @wrap in order to see the url, but of course this is quite clumsy.
I'll look into this before the next release.

.. @+node:ekr.20130806072439.20374: *4* aha moment when using leo script with @url, and feature request ;-)
@nocolor

From: HaveF <iamaplayer@gmail.com>

--089e013d15d83c19e104da3a18ca


Hi, ;-)


1. Aha
Sometimes, I just wonder, I write a script (say, @button button-1) in
leo-file-A.leo, and reuse it by copy(ctrl+shift+c) the button
to leo-file-B.leo.

When I'm working on leo-file-B.leo, I may have ideas to improve the
@button button-1, but at that time(working on leo-file-B.leo), I may
forget where the original place of @button button-1 is. Even I store
the original scripts in the default workbook.leo is a tedious work to
deal with(open it, locate where the original script is, update it...)

But! After I add the @url at the first line of @button button-1, I can
decide
if the improvements what I made on leo-file-B.leo's @button button-1
should or shouldn't be merged to the original and upstream @button
button-1(in leo-file-A.leo) easily by just a click.

And if I work on leo-file-C.leo, I want to use the same script, but I just
only remember I use the script in the leo-file-B.leo instead of
 original place. With @url I can easily jump to original
place, and copy it to leo-file-C.leo.

Using @url in the leo script, I can make the scripts consistency and
diversity at same time.

Great!
But, Wait, wait!

2. Feature request
At this time, you can use this idea by comment the @url line
after jump. If @url isn't comment, the leo-editor will say...
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
at the @url line.

Maybe it is a good idea to omit the @url line in the script when executing
script?

Yes.  I think this is a good idea.  A similar idea occurred to me when
looking at @rclick nodes.  At present, the context_menu plugin contains an
ugly hack:  it allows an @rclick node to *follow* an @button node.  This is
needed at present when the @button node contains @others: the @rclick node
can't be part of the script "pulled in" by @others.

It would be much more elegant to ignore @rclick nodes when computing the
script.  This would require a change to the @others logic, but I think it
is worthwhile.


Not sure when I'll get around to the (documentation must come first), but
I'll put it on the list.

I do this kind of thing by keeping buttons in @files...

@file ~/.leo/gen  # general utility buttons
@file ~/.leo/dml  # tools for editing an XML dialect I use
@file ~/.leo/sql  # tools for editing SQL / interacting with server

so changes made in one outline are automatically propagated to other
outlines next time they're reloaded.  You just reference the files
in each outline where you want those buttons.

This probably would make sense, already the scripting machinery is
ignoring things like @nocolor or @language cobol or @nowrap etc.

Maybe you could file a wish-list bug item for tracking.

Hi,

When I use auto-rst import rst file, sometimes, the author write extra
characters
which aren't harm, but the leo says it is a error...like this one:

reading: @auto-rst README

Error: @auto did not import @auto-rst README perfectly
The clean-all-lines command may help fix whitespace problems
first mismatched line: 20 (original) = 20 (imported)

Original file...

  18 u'how the learning experiment went.\\n'
  19 u'Step 1: Create the dataset\\n'
  20 u'----------------------------\\n'
  21 u'From this directory, run\\n'
  22 u'python make_dataset.py\\n'

Imported file...

  18 u'how the learning experiment went.\\n'
  19 u'Step 1: Create the dataset\\n'
  20 u'--------------------------\\n'
  21 u'From this directory, run\\n'
  22 u'python make_dataset.py\\n'

inserting @ignore

errors inhibited read @auto
D:\\OpenCourses\\ufldl\\ref\\pylearn2\\pylearn2\\scripts\\tutorials\\grbm_smd\\README

reading entire file into @auto node.

reading: @edit README

finished


The problem is the line 20 has two extra '-', when I remove it manually,
the import works.

Do you have a better idea to do this than do it manually?

Thanks!

But in fact, the @auto-rst load this rst file like @auto, no @ignore node 
at all.

My import procedure is like this:
1. make a node name:
@auto-rst models.txt
2. right click it, and select "refresh from disk"


And I just find another problem...
If the rst file like this:

MLP
===

It also occurs error:

reading: @auto-rst models.txt

Error: @auto did not import @auto-rst models.txt perfectly
The clean-all-lines command may help fix whitespace problems

It says I need a extra "="...

I have attached this file, for someone has interest to reproduce the error.

At first I thought that the rst was invalid, but the docs. say
  The underline/overline must be at 
  least as long as the title text. 
http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html#section-structure
so I guess it's not.  But leo has nowhere to store the length of the
underlining.  Also, this is related to the issue where Leo changes the
underline characters used, e.g. = -> - and * -> # etc.

I think the easiest solution is going to be to do the import and just
remove the @ignore afterwards, checking that there are no changes that
matter.  Perhaps the wording of the @ignore message could make it
clearer that the import may not have failed, but just needs checking.

@nocolor

From: "kevin@ksvanhorn.com" <kvanhorn@ksvanhorn.com>

I think I know the cause of the problem with file URLs on Mac OS 10.7
Lion. In leoGlobals.py, in the method os_startfile(fname), we have

    elif sys.platform == 'darwin':
        # From Marc-Antoine Parent.
        try:
            subprocess.call(['open', quoted_fname])
        except OSError:
            pass # There may be a spurious "Interrupted system call"
        except ImportError:
            os.system('open %s' % (quoted_fname))

The problem is that the quoted file path is being passed to
subprocess.call, instead of the raw file path. I verified this by
experimenting with subprocess.call() in a Python interactive mode
window -- it doesn't want the path to be quoted. I also modified the
os_startfile method to use the unquoted pathname, and verified that
this fixed the problem.

hi, I'm starting to play with autocompletions. I'm using the development
version (dowloaded around 20 days ago).

The first inconsistency I've found between what the docs say, and the real
keystrokes needed to get @language python autocompletion is:

* the docs say that if you type a dot, autocompletion activates opening the
objects correlated to the object that precedes the dot; if no object
precedes the dot, you get a list of available modules.

* if in a node which has no text in its head, I type @language python, then
if I type g. nothing appears; however if I type ctrl space (which it
ocurred to me based in pgadmin3's keystrokes to autocomplete, just trial
and error on my part, since tab did not do nothing special), then I get a
list of autocompletions. That's fine.

* I'd make the autocompletion window taller, since where there are dozens
of options, browsing a 7-line window gets hard. I plan to hack it myself.

* if in an empty line I type a dot, nothing appears.  If I type ctrl space,
I get this exception:

exception executing command

I've seen that traceback too, but autocomplete *everything* didn't seem

It works for me when using the auto-completer *tab*.  Are you using the tab
or the QCompleter popup window?  From the traceback, I guess you are using
the QCompleter...

Is period bound to auto-complete?  Use the print-bindings command to see.

Just an idea:

After discovering sublime edit, I have started using external editor mode
more (rclick -> Edit in...). Annoyance there is that once you save in
external editor, you still have to go to leo and save there, or your
changes will be lost if you close leo without saving.

This can lead to loss of date if you don't routinely agree to save changes
when closing Leo. I often don't do this, as I save all the time when I
type, and don't want to save accidental changes I might have done to the
leo document; I don't usually have time to review changes when closing a
document.

Maybe .leo could automatically save the tree if and only if the externally
edited node is the only dirty one.

I agree there is a problem, but I don't believe hacking Leo's save logic is
a good idea, for several reasons:

1. There might be several dirty nodes, and you could still lose data
(strictly following your suggestion) in that case.

2. The write logic for external files is complex, mainly due to file
caching.  I tolerate that complexity because caching is such a big win.
But it would not be easy to do @file AI to discover the special case you
mention.

3. Imo, the proper place to handle this problem is in the vim and xemacs
plugins.  These plugins are responsible for the interaction with Leo.

Would it work for you if the xemacs and vim plugins automatically saved an
external file whenever the plugin caused a node in that file to become
dirty?  This would likely solve the problem you mention, although I
wouldn't be my life on it.

Your comments, please.

Edward

Coincidentally I added the alt-X command 'context-menu-open' a week or
so ago, letting you open the context menu with a keyboard binding so
you can then navigate the menu with the cursor keys.

This is because not all menu entries can have alt-X commands,
specifically the quickMove plugins commands for moving nodes to
pre-defined destinations in other outlines, this is basically a list
selection operation, but being on a sub-sub-menu it's a pain with the
mouse, and easier with the cursor keys.

This is part of my method for handling todo items for different
projects, they are imported from email to one outline, and then I file
them to the relevant project outline's todo node.  Which creates a
management problem I just found a surprisingly viable solution for I'll
mention in another post.

I've been bit by this several times too.

It's lead to me relying on pyscripter (my usual external editor these days,
has more useful to me command completion than leo) more and more, when I
otherwise might just nip out, do a few things and come back.

Maybe a relatively safe solution is to do this:

But not do this:

This way, if you "want to be safe", you will create an external @file for
the content.

For situation 2), some kind of loud warning is in order, not sure of what
kind though. Red g.es?

I wouldn't change the save logic, I'd just execute "save" for the full .leo
document when

- Node has changed in external editor.
- The node that changed is the only dirty node in the whole leo document.

I don't use xemacs/vim plugin, but rather "edit in" in right click menu
(contextmenu.py plugin IIRC).

I agree that this is not an elegant proposal, in that it involves a
potentially surprising (if useful) special case.

I have to think this a bit more. Perhaps some kind of extra warning in the
UI for this scenario would do the trick as well.

I believe that c.openWith should be able to deal with this problem.  
c.openWith creates a temporary external file and updates a node when the 
user changes that file.  This logic is independent of the editor being 
used; it works, for example, with Scite, my default external editor.

Clearly, c.openWith (or rather, one of its helpers) is able to update the 
node and to mark it dirty.  So at the time the node is marked dirty 
c.openWith has an opportunity to automatically save the file containing the 
vnode.  c.openWith can issue a colored message to the log pane, but that 
should be the only "warning" necessary.

My present plan is to write a helper, say c.write_vnode, that will discover 
the external file (if any) containing the vnode, and immediately write that 
external file *without* a prompt.  If there is no external file, 
c.write_vnode could just do an ordinary save of the .leo file and all dirty 
external files.  Alternatively, c.write_vnode could write only the .leo 
file (the write-outline-only command) *without* clearing the c.changed bit.

I believe c.write_vnode will solve this problem fairly completely.  What do 
you think, Amigos?

The "helper" is the idle-time hook,  editnode_on_idle, in contextmenu.py.
You could call this good news, because our experiments with auto-saving can
be confined to the contextmenu plugin.  If our experiments end happily we
can use the same techniques in the vim and xemacs plugins.

I'll wait awhile for your comments before going ahead with the proposed
changes.

Thanks for this suggestion.  I have a great distrust of all operations
containing "if" statements in their explanation.  Somehow, we need a
simpler approach, but I don't know what it is.

For now, I'm going to file this under Leo/Bugs.  Feel free to up the heat
by posting a real bug report.

I agree that if the code is going to do something like this it should issue
a clear warning that something has happened.  Otoh, such "clear warnings"
tend to get ignored :-)  Indeed, the problem is that you are *already*
ignoring such a clear warning!  Adding another warning is not likely to be
a big help...

Hi Terry,

Inspired by the recent problem Nils reported with the 4.10 final installer,
I've built a batch file to make running the development snapshots a little
easier, attached. Here is the header:

{{{
@echo
:: A batch file which generates other batch files to run the Leo Editor,
:: adapted for the local machine. Optionally, it will also set the Windows
:: filetype and association so .leo files can be opened from Explorer.
::
:: It needs to live in the same folder as "launchLeo.py"
::
:: Open Source X/MIT License
:: initial version * 2012-Dec-13 * matt wilkie <maphew@gmail.com>
}}}

Feel free to use, modify or discard as you see fit.

Although it can register the filetype and association, removing them is
left as an exercise for the reader (`assoc /? && ftype /?`); maybe later.
;-)

cheers,

-matt

Re "@", that instructables says the same thing, to my reading. SS64 might
be a better reference site: http://ss64.com/nt/echo.html. Just ponder this:
why do we commonly use "@echo off" instead of "echo off" ?

Re: "\\\\in\\\\path" not working on XP for you. Interesting, I've used it on XP
myself without troubles many times. I did turn up an unanswered question on
Stack Overflow about the same thing with double-double slashes:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/729151/double-backslash-not-work

So It looks like the safe thing to do is strip the extra slash, even if it
does play havoc with most editor's syntax highlighting of variables.

Ah, I see what you were getting at now.  My apologies, you are correct.

I don't often write Windows batch scripts... only out of necessity, 
really.  And I was a bit groggy last night when I was reading that.

I agree that it's absolutely bizarre, but that's the situation I'm in.  
As I mentioned, it might be some security setting that isn't well 
documented, might be a Win XP bug, etc.

If we're not aiming to support Win XP, then we could live with the 
double slash - I see no evidence of this happening on other Windows 
OSes.  Also, Microsoft is ending free support for Win XP next year. But 
personally, I would vote to keep XP supported - an abnormally large 
proportion of users are on XP still.

Matt - this is an old thread, but the gist was to include

https://code.google.com/p/maphew/source/browse/other/create-leobat.bat.

in the top level Leo directory and point windows users to it in the
docs. and the nightly .zip page.

Can you review the above to see if it needs any changes and confirm
adding it still makes sense in light of other Leo association things
you've come up with more recently?  I'm guessing it could still be
helpful.

ah yes. this is missing in latest docs for v 4.9:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/installing.html#installing-leo-on-windows

and it is there in the v4.8 docs:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/install.html#installing-leo-on-windows

i think this doc is cool and it should be reinserted with some
changes, see my answer in other thread.

Done, two small changes added:

create-leobat.bat: change gui Leo launch to Start command (after Jacob Peck);
assoc and ftype commands were in inverted order; change ftype name to follow
python patter (LeoFile --> Leo.File)


In my opinion it's ready to go, pending the results of Jacob's feedback.

Do you remember why you needed to use `%%1` in place of `%%*` ?

The former will only pass the 1st parameter while the 2nd will pass
everything. So when using `%%1` the second and further files or parameters
will be ignored. I didn't come up with a scenario where that is needed or
an improvement, but perhaps I'm missing a use case were it is(?)

Since writing that batch file I notice the association created by the
Python.org installer uses this syntax:

    C:\\pythonXX\\python.exe "%1" %*

This got me curious enough to do some digging.This is what happens on my
machine (Win7 x64; parts omitted for clarity).

-----
    ::leo.bat
    start "leo" /B "b:\\o4w\\bin\\pythonw.exe"
"B:\\apps\\leo-editor\\launchLeo.py" "%*"

usage example and result:

    B:\\>leo first.leo second.leo

    B:\\>start "leo" /B "b:\\o4w\\bin\\pythonw.exe"
"B:\\apps\\leo-editor\\launchLeo.py" "first.leo second.leo"

only 2nd workbook opens

-----
    ::leo.bat
    start ... "%1"

usage example and result:

    B:\\>leo first.leo second.leo

    B:\\>start ... "first.leo"

only 1st workbook opens

------
    ::leo.bat
    start ... %*

usage example and result:

    B:\\>leo first.leo second.leo

    B:\\>start ... first.leo second.leo

both workbooks open

-----
and finally, the python filetype syntax:

    ::leo.bat
    start ... "%1" %*

usage example and result:

    leo first.leo second.leo "third with space.leo"

    B:\\>start /b "Leo" "b:\\o4w\\bin\\pythonw.exe"
"B:\\apps\\leo-editor\\launchLeo.py"
"first.leo" first.leo second.leo "third with space.leo"

All 3 workbooks open. So it seems harmless that the first is listed twice,
though I imagine there would be a performance impact if it were a large leo
file. I don't see a reason for using this syntax though.

more slightly off topic comments in your gist (shortly).

I'm going to file this under Leo/Install for now.  This will give it a
fairly high priority for the next release, as I'll explain in another post.

as noted in the other thread, you've stumbled over an omission in the docs.
Here is the manual recipe for benefit of the thread archives:
 Installing Leo on Windows

   1.

   Install Python from http://www.python.org/download/releases/
   2.

   Install either Tk or Qt, as described above.
   3.

   Install Leo. Get Leo=92s .zip file from
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/leo/ You can unpack the .zip file
   anywhere, including Python=92s *site-packages* folder, for example,
   C:\\Python26\\Lib\\site-packages
   4.

   [optional] Generate/update a junction link from unpacked leo folder to
   ...\\site-packages\\leo:

   cd C:\\Python26\\Lib\\site-packages\\
   junction leo leo-4-6-2-final

    5.

   Create windows shortcut (edit paths as necessary):

   Target   =3D  C:\\Python26\\pythonw.exe
"C:\\Python26\\Lib\\site-packages\\leo\\launchLeo.py"
   Start in =3D  D:\\code

    6.

   Associate .leo filetype batch file:

   ftype LeoFile=3DC:\\Python26\\pythonw.exe
"C:\\Python26\\Lib\\site-packages\\leo\\launchLeo.py" "%*"
   assoc .leo=3DLeoFile

    7.

   [optional] Put this leo.bat in %PATH%:

   @C:\\Python26\\python.exe "C:\\Python26\\Lib\\site-packages\\leo\\launchLeo.py"=
 %*


For more information see:

Edward - I haven't tested this batch file to register the .leo
extension and make batch files to run leo in Windows, not using
windows, but it looks useful. Here's the current contents of the Leo
root dir:

bzr-manifest.txt         leo_to_html.xsl  pylint-leo.py
INSTALL.TXT              LICENSE.TXT      README.TXT
launchLeo.py             Makefile         setup.py
leo                      PKG-INFO.TXT     stand_along_globals.leo
leo.nsi                  profileLeo.py
leoStandAloneGlobals.py  pylint-leo.bat

so it seems adding another file, create-leobat.bat, can't hurt, do you
agree?

On the snapshot download page I'll add pointer to the create-leobat.bat
for windows users and I guess it should go in the docs. somewhere also.

L32: Good question why I did that... no clue, really. It works, though, 
for my purposes.|%%*|is probably correct, and I will revise this.

L34-35: Google says 
otherwise:http://www.instructables.com/id/Slightly-More-Advanced-Basic-Batch/step2/ECHO-OFFON-Command/
That being said, I did test this both with and without the@echo 
<https://gist.github.com/echo>off line... and it only worked with 
the@echo <https://gist.github.com/echo>off line. At least on my systems 
(2 win xp, 1 win 7 64).

L21: It was complaining on my WinXP boxes, but that could be a security 
setting. Both of my WinXP boxes are the property of my employer, and 
they have some pretty crazy security protocols in place. Not sure if 
that has anything to do with it, but my WinXP boxes didn't like the 
extra slash at all.

@nocolor

From: Nick_H <nah@plextek.co.uk>

Sorry, this is probably a foolish question, but when I double-click on
any Leo file on my desktop to launch Leo, it simply launches with the
default workbook.leo file open.
I can, of course, open any file via the File|Open dialog, but that's
not so convenient.
The file association contains the following command to execute for the
Open operation:
"C:\\Tools\\Python32\\python.exe" "C:\\Tools\\Leo-4.10-final\\launchLeo.py
%*"

Can you suggest what might be wrong?
Thank you!

Good catch.  I think rather than updating this for every release, I'll
try to generalize it a bit so people will understand what is intended.
 The fix will probably be tricky: it's so hard to be clear and general
at the same time.  Otoh, making instructions
Python-and-Leo-version-depenedent is pretty hopeless.

it's the trailing %*, use "%1" instead.

You want %*  in a batch file. It passes all command line arguments to
the program being called.

"%1" passes just the file being clicked on, quoted for spaces etc.
When in a batch file %1 passes just the first command line parameter.

It is logical to expect %* to work for click file association as well,
but it doesn't. I don't know why.

Many thanks to all for these replies!
This is my final "open" string in the Windows file associations:
"C:\\Tools\\Python32\\python.exe" "C:\\Tools\\Leo-4.10-final\\launchLeo.py"=20
--gui=3Dqttabs "%1"
Note that the brackets are needed round the %1 to cater for file paths=20

Yes, many cool tools like this use autohotkey, or a certain compiler that 
also gets used for some malware and triggers false positives for some of 
the sloppier a/v packages.

The last set of double quotes looks wrong.  Try:

"C:\\Tools\\Python32\\python.exe" "C:\\Tools\\Leo-4.10-final\\launchLeo.py" %*

In this case, none of the double quotes are needed, because the paths
have no embedded blanks, so this also should work:

C:\\Tools\\Python32\\python.exe C:\\Tools\\Leo-4.10-final\\launchLeo.py %*

Finally, unless you have a strong reason not to do so, I would suggest
adding the --gui=qttabs option::

C:\\Tools\\Python32\\python.exe C:\\Tools\\Leo-4.10-final\\launchLeo.py
--gui=qttabs %*

This is a bit OT, but: for those like me who work in "portable" mode, 
there's a very cool tool called "PortableFileAssociator" that allows you to 
create a set of windows file associations, icons etc and enable/disable the 
whole profile at one time, without messing with the local system's registry.

Also handy for those not in portable mode, but working on different windows 
boxes and bored with having to tweak each one separately.
.. @+node:ekr.20130806072439.20428: *4* create relative urls when dragging binary files to Leo
@nocolor

From: Josef <joe_da@gmx.net>




I would prefer if the @url created when a binary file (PDF) is dragged into 
Leo would be a *relative* one,
e.g. if I drag a file foo.pdf, which sits in the same directory as the Leo 
file into Leo, then I would expect to end up with a headline like:
@url foo.pdf, and not as it is now: @url file:///home/.../foo.pdf.

I would even expect this to be @url ../foo.pdf if the PDF sits in the 
parent directory or @url ../sibling/foo.pdf if it sits in the sibling 
directory etc.
Python (os.path) has facilities to build relative paths, so most of the 
logic for this is already there.

The advantage of a relative path is: I can then move the whole directory 
tree including Leo file and referenced files and the links still work, and 
I can share both Leo and referenced files via SVN or similar, since my 
co-workers are likely to have different absolute paths then I.

In some cases an absolute path is needed, though - so I would suggest to 
create one by ctrl-dragging or alt-dragging or so.

Done at rev 5474.

I am considering a small change to dynamic-expands.  Presently, this
is equivalent to dynamic-completion if there is only one completion
available: the single completion is inserted directly.

But I think it is better always to put up the completion list even if
it contains only one item.  That way  <backspace><tab> may show more
completions.

From: "F.S." <speech.free@gmail.com>

In Emacs M-/ (dabbrev-expand) just expands to the first choice. You then 
cycle through the choices by repeating M-/. If you go too far you can cycle 
back with C-/. C-M-/ (dabbrev-completion) expands to the longest common 
prefix.
With 5473 I seem to already get the behavior you are talking about: that on 
M-/ I get a completion list. I agree that getting a list is nice, esp 
if <backspace><tab> show more choices (in 5473 they don't seem to).

I think there are a few use cases here:
1) I know exactly what I want but I just don't want to type it again (I may 
be lazy or I don't want to create a typo) so give it to me with as few key 
strokes as possible
2) I am not quite sure so let me see the choices
3) None of the choices is what I need so let me go back and show me some 
more choices

Maybe a combination of behavior is the best. With M-/ and C-/ one just 
cycles through the choices (auto inserted), which takes care of 1). 
With C-M-/ (dabbrev-completion) one gets the longest prefix auto inserted 
and a list of choices. Now it would be truly great that if we can easily 
just <backspace><tab> to see potentially more choices. But how do you 
interface with both? For 2) one desires to type just one more letter so as 
to make a choice in the choice list. For 3) we need to go back but may need 
backspace quite a bit to get back to before where we started (the only 
place where we can get new choices) -- can that be achieved with a single 
backspace instead?

For example suppose I have abcdefg and abwxyz. I type abc, C-M-/ and 
abcdefg is the sole completion. I may not want it but it would be nice to 
not have to backspace all the way to b to see the other choice. In other 
word if I backspace at all it is understood that I want to go before where 
I started (before where the auto insertion takes place). That would be neat!

I took a look at flattr, but it requires monthly contributions and

will use monthly contributions on their discretion if it were no

The more options for donations - the better! Ideally it would be great

.. @+node:ekr.20130806072439.20450: *5* Bat file launchers for nightly builds
From: Matt Wilkie <maphew@gmail.com>

Hi Terry,

Inspired by the recent problem Nils reported with the 4.10 final installer,
I've built a batch file to make running the development snapshots a little
easier, attached. Here is the header:

{{{
@echo
:: A batch file which generates other batch files to run the Leo Editor,
:: adapted for the local machine. Optionally, it will also set the Windows
:: filetype and association so .leo files can be opened from Explorer.
::
:: It needs to live in the same folder as "launchLeo.py"
::
:: Open Source X/MIT License
:: initial version * 2012-Dec-13 * matt wilkie <maphew@gmail.com>
}}}

Feel free to use, modify or discard as you see fit.

Although it can register the filetype and association, removing them is
left as an exercise for the reader (`assoc /? && ftype /?`); maybe later.
;-)

> thats cool but i would also like to have a bit of doc how to do it manually.

as noted in the other thread, you've stumbled over an omission in the docs.
Here is the manual recipe for benefit of the thread archives:

 Installing Leo on Windows

1. Install Python from http://www.python.org/download/releases/

2. Install either Tk or Qt, as described above.

3. Install Leo. Get Leo=92s .zip file from http://sourceforge.net/projects/leo/
   You can unpack the .zip file anywhere, including Python=92s *site-packages* folder, for example::
   
   C:\\Python26\\Lib\\site-packages
   
4. [optional] Generate/update a junction link from unpacked leo folder to ...\\site-packages\\leo::

    cd C:\\Python26\\Lib\\site-packages\\
    junction leo leo-4-6-2-final

5. Create windows shortcut (edit paths as necessary)::

    Target C:\\Python26\\pythonw.exe
    "C:\\Python26\\Lib\\site-packages\\leo\\launchLeo.py"
    Start in D:\\code

6. Associate .leo filetype batch file::

    ftype LeoFile=3DC:\\Python26\\pythonw.exe
    "C:\\Python26\\Lib\\site-packages\\leo\\launchLeo.py" "%*"
    assoc .leo=3DLeoFile

7. [optional] Put this leo.bat in %PATH%::

    @C:\\Python26\\python.exe "C:\\Python26\\Lib\\site-packages\\leo\\launchLeo.py" %*

For more information see:

> as noted in the other thread, you've stumbled over an omission in the docs.

ah yes. this is missing in latest docs for v 4.9:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/installing.html#installing-leo-on-windows

and it is there in the v4.8 docs:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/install.html#installing-leo-on-windows

i think this doc is cool and it should be reinserted with some
changes, see my answer in other thread.

cheers, Nils

Thanks Terry. I didn't know/remember you're not running Windows, else I
wouldn't have lobbed it at you first. ;-)

Edward - I haven't tested this batch file to register the .leo
extension and make batch files to run leo in Windows, not using
windows, but it looks useful. Here's the current contents of the Leo
root dir:

bzr-manifest.txt         leo_to_html.xsl  pylint-leo.py
INSTALL.TXT              LICENSE.TXT      README.TXT
launchLeo.py             Makefile         setup.py

leo.nsi                  profileLeo.py
leoStandAloneGlobals.py  pylint-leo.bat

so it seems adding another file, create-leobat.bat, can't hurt, do you
agree?

On the snapshot download page I'll add pointer to the create-leobat.bat
for windows users and I guess it should go in the docs. somewhere also.

Cheers -Terry

I'm going to file this under Leo/Install for now.  This will give it a
fairly high priority for the next release, as I'll explain in another post.

.. @+node:ekr.20130806072439.20458: *5* importing a medium sized java project ~ 400 files
From: Todd Greenwood-Geer <t.greenwoodgeer@gmail.com>




Hi - 
I typically use Intellij IDEA when writing java or scala code. I'm 
currently wrapping up a project with about 400 java files and a handful of 
html/bash/python. As a test, I tried importing this project into leo, as 
follows:

(see  http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.leo.general/20173)

1. open leo, use the default workbook project or create a new one
2. copy the 'recursive auto create' script from scripts.leo to  my leo 
project
3. edit it to reflect what i'm doing: here's mine below:

#outline
scripts/@path [some path, say '/home/user/projects']/@path [this project 
'foo']

#node
 
import os


@others


types = ('.py', '.java', '.scala', '.sh', '.build', '.gradle', '.html', 
'.js')

theDir = r'.'


if g.os_path_exists(theDir):

importFiles(theDir,types,recursive=True)

g.es("done",color="blue")

else:

g.es("directory does not exist: " + theDir)


4. ok, so this imports my project...note that on a six core machine, this 
takes 10 minutes or so.

At this point, I have a few questions:

Q: How could I have referenced the @Path from within the script? I opted 
for the cheap and easy route by simply using '.', and hey, it worked! Is 
that idiomatic?

Q: The real issue I'm having is that when I press Ctrl-S to save, I am 
asked if I want to modify the file...um, for each file. The only way out of 
this is to kill the process. What am I doing wrong? And, this, btw - seems 
at least partly like a bug.

Q: Supposing that I can successfully import a project, how do I make it a 
shadow project?

Suggestions:

1. I first started looking into leo a year or so ago. I thought it was 
amazing, but then dropped it b/c other projects took precedence. 
Personally, I think the 'killer' feature is the ability to embed diagrams 
and notes within the context of code. I'm sure it's possible to open an 
external editor based on the file type...but typically, one is going to 
edit a diagram and that product will spit out it's custom file format. At 
some point you'll use the diagram editor to spit out an image file that 
something like leo could display. It would be so cool if that sort of 
integration could be made smoother. Either do all the editing within leo 
(probably not possible) or have leo invoke the target editor and somehow 
display the image as appropriate.

2. I'm a developer, and I happen to really enjoy programming in python. 
However, even for me, the documentation is a bit daunting. This tool does 
so much, it's a bit overwhelming. In the back of my head, I hear, 'screw 
this, let's get some work done in VIM, iPython, IDEA, etc.". One thing I 
keep wondering is whether I really need to have clone nodes in the type of 
coding I do... I only ever define a function once. However, the ability to 
force my focus onto just a single function is really nice... really 
isolates things.

3. On the flip side, it took me just a few minutes to add my own key

Leo has several global functions in leoGlobals.py that handle directives.
See::

    @file leoGlobals.py-->Commands & Directives-->g.Directive utils...

They are not particularly easy to use, though.  Look through Leo's sources
for examples.

It surely is a bug.  I might have made a private note to myself about this,
but just in case I'll mark this email as a bug deserving quick attention.

By changing @auto or @file or whatever to @shadow, then saving.

Suggestions:

Not a bad idea, but it has low priority at present.

Letting people know what Leo can *already* do has the highest priority.  An
improved help system is a start.  Creating much simpler tutorials is
another step.  Most of this should happen before the next official release.

That may happen, but I wouldn't wait for it :-) Please feel free to ask
whatever questions you like.  Answering those questions becomes pre-writing
for tutorials and other documentation, so it has very high priority.

Hi Folks,

I've just uploaded Leo-4.11-devel-build-5759 to the Python Package Index:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/leo-editor

It can be downloaded from there and installed manually or, better yet,
installed with `pip install leo-editor`.

enjoy!

to keep in step with the read the docs project, after the login stuff is
sorted out it would be be good to deprecate "leo" in favour of "leo-editor"
on pypi.

oh nuts. I just realised why this whole process was smoother than I

Also if you add me to the maintainer role under
https://pypi.python.org/pypi?:action=role_form&package_name=leo I'll go
through and clean out the old version archives and other assorted
janitorial work. All pypi passwords were reset a few months ago so you'll
likely need to a recovery go-around.

If you'd rather keep this under your own bailiwick I'm cool with that too.

cheers,

-matt

Well, I don't seem to be able to log into pypi or reset my password.  It
may be being sent to an old email address.  No obvious support.  This whole
login process is hosed.

Hello,

I am looking into using Leo for a few php projects at work.
I think I have figured out how to use Leo, but was wondering if someone
could have a look at my small test project and let me know if I am using it
correctly.

I like the idea of Leo, however I get the impression that if I use it
'wrong' then it will be more of a hindrance than a help.

note: I have emailed this to the group with the workbook attached, please
let me know if there are any problems as I am also new to google groups.

Thanks

Just realised that that attachment is useless.

What I have is :
Nodes:
@file foo.php
@file test.php
----- << includes >>
----- << Connect to the database >>
----- << Disconnect from the database >>
----- << Test echo >>
----- << External file class test >>

@file foo:
<?php
    class Foo
    {
        public $foo;
        public $bar;
        
        public function foobar()
        {
            echo $foo . $bar;
        }
    }
?>

@file test.php
<?php
    << includes >>
    << Connect to the database >>
    << Test echo >>
    << Disconnect from the database >>
    << External file class test >>
?>

<<includes>>:
require('foo.php');

<< Connect to the database >>
echo "Connecting to the database";

<< Test echo >>:
echo "This is a test";

<< Disconnect from the database >>:
echo "Disconnecting from the database";

<< External file class test >>:
$foo = new Foo();

$foo->foo = "foo";
$foo->bar = "bar";

$foo->foobar();


Does this seem right? Or should I be doing something differently?

Thanks

.. @+node:ekr.20130806072439.20469: *5* Problem Creating a new outline using leoBridge
From: SegundoBob <bhossley@ieee.org>




I'm trying to create a new Leo-Editor outline file using leoBridge and I'm 
stuck with this error:

$ python .temp.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ".temp.py", line 17, in <module>
    ptrDay = ptrRoot.insertAsLastChild()
  File "/home/ldi/bzr/LeoLatest/leo/core/leoNodes.py", line 1212, in

  File "/home/ldi/bzr/LeoLatest/leo/core/leoNodes.py", line 488, in 
numberOfChildren
    return len(p.v.children)
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'children'

Here is my program .temp.py:

 pathLeo = '/home/ldi/tmp/debug/rfd1207.leo'


import sys

sys.path.append("/home/ldi/bzr/LeoLatest/") 

import leo.core.leoBridge as leoBridge


bridge = leoBridge.controller(gui='nullGui',verbose=False)

cmdr = bridge.openLeoFile(pathLeo)

ptrRoot = cmdr.rootPosition()

ptrDay = ptrRoot.insertAsLastChild()
-------- end program ------------------

I seem to have an outline and it seems to have a root position, but this 
root position does not have a "vnode".

You can donate via flattr.

Hi Edward, is it possible to donate Leo via PayPal?

I took a look at flattr, but it requires monthly contributions and
looks like not very suitable way for one-time payments. Also, they
will use monthly contributions on their discretion if it were no
flattr clicks in a month.

The more options for donations - the better! Ideally it would be great
to see a "How to donate Leo" page with different donation options on
your site!

Kind regarads,
Sergei

@nocolor

From: "kevin@ksvanhorn.com" <kvanhorn@ksvanhorn.com>

I can put an http URL in a header and command-left-click it, and it
shows up correctly. Or I can put @url in the header and the http URL
as the first line in the body, and command-left-click takes me to the
page. But no matter what I try, I cannot get file URLs to work. What
seems to happen is this:

If I give a path to a nonexistent file, I get an error message in the
log window.

If I give a valid path to an existing file, I get an error message *in
the terminal window* from which I launched lion, of the form

 'The file /path/to/my/home/dir/.leo/"/absolute/path/to/the/file" does
not exist'

or

 'The file /path/to/leo/config/"/absolute/path/to/the/file" does not
exist'

That is, it takes the correct file path and prepends the path to the
system config dir or my personal .leo dir to it. I have tried this
both giving absolute paths and giving relative paths from either
my .leo dir or the system leo config dir; in every case, if I don't
get an error in the log window, then I get an error in the terminal
window of the form described above. It appears that one part of the
code is correctly creating the appropriate absolute path, and then
passing it to another part of the code that wants to interpret this
absolute path as a path relative to the location of a *.leo file.

@nocolor

From: Chema Cortes <pych3m4@gmail.com>

I have some external files encoded with utf8 and utf16-le with BOM
marks. Leo ignores these marks, become these files garbled. I cannot
fix this problem with @enconding directives.

Reading the code, I can see the problem when leo opens files as
binary, followed by a unicode encoding. Why not use, instead, the
'codecs.open' for this job, more friendly with BOM-marks?

.. @+node:ekr.20130806072439.20477: *4* I can't make Leo-Editor start in a full-screen window under openSUSU 12.1
@nocolor

From: SegundoBob <bhossley@ieee.org>




I much prefer to almost always use Leo-editor in a full-screen window.   
When I run Ubuntu 11.10 with either the Fluxbox or the Gnome Classic 
sessions, when I re-open an outline that was last closed when its window 
was full-screen, Leo-Editor comes up in a full-screen window.  When I run 
openSUSE 12.1 with either the XFCE or IceWM sessions, Leo-Editor never 
comes up in a full-screen widow.  In all my tests I used exactly the same 
Leo-Editor for all operating systems and session managers.

Other applications can be made to come up in full-screen windows under 
openSUSE 12.1.  For example, Thunderbird and Thunar will come up in 
full-screen windows.

I have seen this problem with all of the following revisions of 
Leo-Editor:  5051, 5089, 5093, 5106, 5113, 5115, 5121, 5123, 5128, 5130, 
5138, 5141, 5143, 5147, 5148, 5161, 5166, 5200, 5220, 5248, and 5252.  I 
believe all my tests used Python 2.7.2, qt version 4.7.4.

Does anyone have any ideas about solving this problem?

I have the exact same behaviour with Leo 4.10 final, build 5286,

It refuses to remember its window settings.

Thanks for the suggestion.  But doing a save does not help with my 
problem.  I was already aware that some parameters are only remembered when 
a save is done--and this is a minor annoyance.  Wouldn't it be better, more 
consistent, and more useable, if every exit saved all the parameters that

then it is restarted in partial-screen mode with an arbitrary unused band

.. @+node:ekr.20130806072439.20482: *4* importing a medium sized java project ~ 400 files
@nocolor

From: Todd Greenwood-Geer <t.greenwoodgeer@gmail.com>




Hi - 
I typically use Intellij IDEA when writing java or scala code. I'm 
currently wrapping up a project with about 400 java files and a handful of 
html/bash/python. As a test, I tried importing this project into leo, as 
follows:

(see  http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.leo.general/20173)

1. open leo, use the default workbook project or create a new one
2. copy the 'recursive auto create' script from scripts.leo to  my leo 
project
3. edit it to reflect what i'm doing: here's mine below:

#outline
scripts/@path [some path, say '/home/user/projects']/@path [this project 
'foo']

#node
 
import os


@others


types = ('.py', '.java', '.scala', '.sh', '.build', '.gradle', '.html', 
'.js')

theDir = r'.'


if g.os_path_exists(theDir):

importFiles(theDir,types,recursive=True)

g.es("done",color="blue")

else:

g.es("directory does not exist: " + theDir)


4. ok, so this imports my project...note that on a six core machine, this 
takes 10 minutes or so.

At this point, I have a few questions:

Q: How could I have referenced the @Path from within the script? I opted 
for the cheap and easy route by simply using '.', and hey, it worked! Is 
that idiomatic?

Q: The real issue I'm having is that when I press Ctrl-S to save, I am 
asked if I want to modify the file...um, for each file. The only way out of 
this is to kill the process. What am I doing wrong? And, this, btw - seems 
at least partly like a bug.

Q: Supposing that I can successfully import a project, how do I make it a 
shadow project?

Suggestions:

1. I first started looking into leo a year or so ago. I thought it was 
amazing, but then dropped it b/c other projects took precedence. 
Personally, I think the 'killer' feature is the ability to embed diagrams 
and notes within the context of code. I'm sure it's possible to open an 
external editor based on the file type...but typically, one is going to 
edit a diagram and that product will spit out it's custom file format. At 
some point you'll use the diagram editor to spit out an image file that 
something like leo could display. It would be so cool if that sort of 
integration could be made smoother. Either do all the editing within leo 
(probably not possible) or have leo invoke the target editor and somehow 
display the image as appropriate.

2. I'm a developer, and I happen to really enjoy programming in python. 
However, even for me, the documentation is a bit daunting. This tool does 
so much, it's a bit overwhelming. In the back of my head, I hear, 'screw 
this, let's get some work done in VIM, iPython, IDEA, etc.". One thing I 
keep wondering is whether I really need to have clone nodes in the type of 
coding I do... I only ever define a function once. However, the ability to 
force my focus onto just a single function is really nice... really 
isolates things.

3. On the flip side, it took me just a few minutes to add my own key 
bindings to switch between tabs. And the view-rendered for rest, markdown, 
html, etc. is really killer. I'm going to play around with this and 
erlang/rebar/cowboy and see how it fits that programming model. All I can 
ask for are more tutorials that just show you doing your normal work 
routine, and more videos with the same sort of focus.

Thanks,
-Todd

Leo has several global functions in leoGlobals.py that handle directives.
See::

    @file leoGlobals.py-->Commands & Directives-->g.Directive utils...

They are not particularly easy to use, though.  Look through Leo's sources
for examples.

It surely is a bug.  I might have made a private note to myself about this,
but just in case I'll mark this email as a bug deserving quick attention.

By changing @auto or @file or whatever to @shadow, then saving.

Not a bad idea, but it has low priority at present.

Letting people know what Leo can *already* do has the highest priority.  An
improved help system is a start.  Creating much simpler tutorials is
another step.  Most of this should happen before the next official release.

That may happen, but I wouldn't wait for it :-) Please feel free to ask
whatever questions you like.  Answering those questions becomes pre-writing
for tutorials and other documentation, so it has very high priority.

@nocolor

From: lewis <lewisneal@operamail.com>

It may be useful to try the installation method suggested at 
http://docutils.sourceforge.net/README.html#installation
    
The introductory comment
"Just double-click install.py. If this doesn't work, try the following:" immediately convinced me to try the steps 1,2,3 :)
So first I unpack the archive
1. Open a Command Shell, MS-DOS Prompt, or Console
2. cd to location of docutils folder:
3. Install the package:
   <path_to_python.exe>\\python setup.py install
   e.g. at prompt C:\\Python33\\python setup.py install

When installing docutils I've never had to use 'python3 setup.py build' or '2to3 build'.
I'm interested to know if this works for you on the next docutils snapshot.

Lewis

.. @+node:ekr.20130806072439.20485: *4* Importing java file using @auto. How do I adjust Leo to ignore whitespace and indentation irregularities?
@nocolor

From: Eoin <eoinmccarthy@fastmail.fm>




Hi, 

I'm using @auto to import java files into my Leo project. I'm then cloning 
various methods as sub-nodes of new feature nodes. 
It's helping keep my development focussed - and is useful to look back and 
see what parts of the codebase I've worked on for each feature. 

However, the whitespace in the Java files isn't completely regular. In 
particular, debug logging is always placed in column 1 - regardless of the 
surrounding indentation. 
Other people are also working on these files, so I'd rather not mess with 
the established convention. 

As things stand, when Leo imports a file its outputting a bunch of error 
messages:
* error: underindented line. Extra leading whitespace will be added
* warning: intermixed blanks and tabs

The creation of the auto node goes fine - though the final result has an 
@ignore directive in its root node. 
When working, I just take the @ignore away and clone the methods I want to 
work on. 
The problem is when I close the Leo file and re-open it later on, the same 
errors occur during the building of the auto node and the previous cloned 
information is lost. 
To restart work on a feature, I need to reclone the appropriate nodes. Not 
a showstopper, but not ideal. 

I tried adjusting the info in the JavaScanner class in the core 
leoImport.py file as follows:

        self.blockCommentDelim1 = '/*'
        self.blockCommentDelim2 = '*/'
        self.blockDelim1 = '{'
        self.blockDelim2 = '}'
        self.lineCommentDelim = '//'
        self.lineCommentDelim2 = None
        self.outerBlockDelim1 = '{'
        self.outerBlockDelim2 = '}'
        self.classTags = ['class','interface']
        self.functionTags = []
        self.sigFailTokens = [';','='] # Just like c.
        self.strict=False

I deleted the pyc file and restarted Leo. A new pyc file appears, so the 
compiled to bytecode seems to be ok.

I was hoping the the setting of self.strict = False would allow the parsing 
to ignore the whitespace and indentation issues. 
I'm still getting the same errors though. 

Any help appreciated. I'm using Leo 4.10-final. 

Thanks,
Eoin

There is no easy way to do this at present, but it's probably reasonable to
disable errors (and not add @ignore) for underindented comments for
non-strict languages.

Please file a wishlist bug for this.  Thanks.

Hello Edward,

now that you've 'cancelled' the 'leo/extensions/docutils' experiment I 
thought I investigate the status of '@rst' and 'docutils' again.

What I see in my local installation is the following:

</log>

Based on your current understanding: Should the '@rst' command with a 
properly installed 'docutils' package work in a Python 3 environment?

With kind regards,

Viktor

The funny part is that I see neither. - What happens in my case is that Leo 
changes from 3 to 4 tiles.

The fourth tile however is  *completely* empty - and - there are also no 
errors or warnings in the console.

At the moment I do not have time to dig any further until at least 
Wednesday. 

Anyhow, thanks a lot for your feedback!

With kind regards,

I've just double-checked.  On  docutils-0.10 python33 setup.py install does
*not* work for me, but the following does work::

- unpack to a temp folder
- cd the temp folder
- python33 setup.py build
- copy temp/build/lib/docutils to python33/Lib/site-customize.

In other words, there is no need for a separate 2to3 step, but for me there
*is* a need to do python setup.py build.  YMMV.

Yes it should, but in my experience installing docutils on Python 3
involves more (on Windows) than just doing setup.py install. I've had to do
the following:

- unpack docutils to a temp folder
- cd the temp folder
- python3 setup.py build
- 2to3 build
- copy the build\\lib\\docutils to your site-customize folder.

Note that you may have to set up a bat file to be able to execute 2to3
easily.

The easy way to see whether docutils is properly installed is to do F1.  If
you see::

*   Welcome to Leo's help system.*

Leo has loaded docutils properly. If you see::

    **Welcome to Leo's help system.**

then Leo could not load docutils.  In that case, Leo uses <pre> to format
help message.

HTH.

It may be useful to try the installation method suggested at 
http://docutils.sourceforge.net/README.html#installation
    
The introductory comment "Just double-click install.py. If this doesn't 
work, try the following:" immediately convinced me to use steps 1,2,3  ;)

So first I unpack the archive, then
1. Open a Command Shell, MS-DOS Prompt, or Console
2. cd to the location of docutils folder:

3  Install the package:
    <path_to_python.exe>\\python setup.py install
    e.g. at prompt C:\\Python33\\python setup.py install

I've never had to use "python3 setup.py build" or "2to3 build" and I'm 
interested to find out if the method above is successful for you on the 
next snapshot.

Lewis

I have now found a reliable way to create the HTML documentation from my 
log-outline.

From my POV it indicates that there is a problem within 'leoRst.py'

If I have not executed F1 before, I get the one or more of the entries, 
that I have reported previously:

<log-1>

Unexpected docutils exception
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "D:\\Branches\\leo-editor\\leo\\core\\leoRst.py", line 1891, in 
writeToDocutils
    result = docutils.core.publish_string(source=s,
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'core'
done

</log-1>

However of I have explicitely executed F1 *before*, the HTML file(s) get 
created, no matter at which level I call the command 'rst3':

<log-2>

To make it clear and explicit: When I execute F1 I now get the proper

Hope this helps you finding the root cause of this issue.

Hello Edward,

even at the latest revision (rev. 5500) Leo does not display all content of 
larger nodes
- Larger nodes approximately defined as >= 150 lines ...

That is searching for example for a 'TO-DO' item just return this 
particular line w/o the
context  around. - Going up - or - down does not refresh the screen & 
content ...

I thought I could provide you with an outline, where this problem 
consistently shows up.
- However, whenever I trim the personal outline I'm using the problem 
disappears.

This problem is really annoying - and - I would gladly provide more input, 
but so far I
fail. - Any suggestion?

With kind regards,

Viktor

I can confirm that this type of bug is still present in 5500 also.

Yesterday I was noticing this:

 - editing a node (A)
 - create new node by accidentally hitting insert
 - delete new node immediately while still in headline edit mode using
   cut-node 
 - node A is displayed incorrectly, a line is missing, selecting the
   body restores the missing line

vs. the above but selecting the body of the inserted node, then
deleting it, in which case A is displayed correctly without selecting
its body.

Today (the outline's changed) it's not doing that, but I still
notice the difference between inserting and immediately deleting a node
(scroll position in A restored incorrectly), vs. inserting a node,
selecting its body, and then deleting it (scroll position in A restored
correctly).

So, there's some execution path difference between A being selected
after an inserted node is deleted immediately (still in headline edit
mode) vs. after selection of its body.

Not a very helpful report, but maybe the difference between deletion of
the node immediately and after selecting its body guides you to a
particular piece of code.

Cheers -Terry

Hi,

I also have the same problem, using the official 4.10 final.
I.e. a couple of lines are missing in the node (the linecounter
increments and decrements but the cursor does not move).

Not sure what report could be useful.
I also feel like it occurs on larger body nodes.

Cheers,
Karl.

Hi,

Same issue for me has been occurring on a large node. Interestingly, I can 
only reproduce the display error when 'Leo Log Window' is at bottom left 
position which is my ''initial_split_orientation' setting (horizontal: body 
pane to the right). 
I can use Window>Toggle Split Direction to correct the initial display 
error.

For me, the display error always becomes evident at line 95.
My line numbers 95,96 are visible then skips to 118. Lines 97 thru 117 are 
not displayed.
It appears to be graphics performance time lag; if I return to the file 
after having switched to another leo tab the previously invisible lines are 
visible.

Leo Log Window
Leo 4.11 devel, build 5647, 2013-04-02 08:03:37
Python 3.3.1, qt version 4.8.4
Windows 6, 1, 7601, 2, Service Pack 1

Lewis

Hi Folks,

I've just uploaded Leo-4.11-devel-build-5759 to the Python Package Index:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/leo-editor

It can be downloaded from there and installed manually or, better yet,
installed with `pip install leo-editor`.

enjoy!

oh nuts. I just realised why this whole process was smoother than I
expected. I called it "leo-editor", while previously Edward has it
registered as "Leo", of course. So now there's 2 leo projects there. Sorry!

Edward, I'm happy to pull the leo-editor dupe down.

Also if you add me to the maintainer role under
https://pypi.python.org/pypi?:action=role_form&package_name=leo I'll go
through and clean out the old version archives and other assorted
janitorial work. All pypi passwords were reset a few months ago so you'll
likely need to a recovery go-around.

If you'd rather keep this under your own bailiwick I'm cool with that too.

cheers,

Well, I don't seem to be able to log into pypi or reset my password.  It
may be being sent to an old email address.  No obvious support.  This whole
login process is hosed.

to keep in step with the read the docs project, after the login stuff is
sorted out it would be be good to deprecate "leo" in favour of "leo-editor"
on pypi.

Great! I saw a number of similar can't login issues filed so thought it
might take awhile to get rectified; glad to be wrong. :)

Oh I just realize I never said this specifically: I'm volunteering to take
care building and uploading pypi packages for the next ... unknown period.
:)  If this is okay with you, just add me (maphew) as maintainer under
Roles<https://pypi.python.org/pypi?:action=role_form&package_name=leo>([login]
>> your packages >> [leo] >> [roles]).

My plan for the pypi package, now that basic install seems to work, is to
add some sugar to the windows installer a) splash picture while installing,
b) auto populate long description from Readme.txt (and/or similar, like
History/Changelog), c) create desktop/start menu shortcuts, d) document
preceding so anyone can do it.

Having read through distutils documentation at least half a dozen times and
still not feeling knowledgeable I understand why! Just to keep expectations
in line, this still doesn't handle installing PyQt or SIP.

If there are no objections I'm going to remove all but one file on Pypi for
each major dot release: e.g. Keep 4.7.1-final, delete 4.7-b2.* etc.

There are over 50 historical packages for Leo listed on pypi, dating back
to 4.4.3.1. They are hidden from normal view but pip will still search
through all of them when looking for a candidate.

If anyone truly needs to revert to a specific version not listed it can be
pulled from Launchpad.

Hello,

I am looking into using Leo for a few php projects at work.
I think I have figured out how to use Leo, but was wondering if someone 
could have a look at my small test project and let me know if I am using it 
correctly. (The workbook should be attached, please let me know if there 
are any problems).

I like the idea of Leo, however I get the impression that if I use it 
'wrong' then it will be more of a hindrance than a help.

Thanks

Just realised that that attachment is useless.

What I have is :
Nodes:
@file foo.php
@file test.php
----- << includes >>
----- << Connect to the database >>
----- << Disconnect from the database >>
----- << Test echo >>
----- << External file class test >>

@file foo:
<?php
    class Foo
    {
        public $foo;
        public $bar;
        
        public function foobar()
        {
            echo $foo . $bar;
        }
    }
?>

@file test.php
<?php
    << includes >>
    << Connect to the database >>
    << Test echo >>
    << Disconnect from the database >>
    << External file class test >>
?>

<<includes>>:
require('foo.php');

<< Connect to the database >>
echo "Connecting to the database";

<< Test echo >>:
echo "This is a test";

<< Disconnect from the database >>:
echo "Disconnecting from the database";

<< External file class test >>:
$foo = new Foo();

$foo->foo = "foo";
$foo->bar = "bar";

$foo->foobar();


Does this seem right? Or should I be doing something differently?

I'm trying to create a new Leo-Editor outline file using leoBridge and I'm

cmdr = bridge.openLeoFile(pathLeo)

ptrRoot = cmdr.rootPosition()

ptrDay = ptrRoot.insertAsLastChild()

I seem to have an outline and it seems to have a root position, but this 
root position does not have a "vnode".

Hi!

I have a @shadow file like this:

http://goo.gl/OE7TS

with only one @others in the root node.

but when I reopen it, the structure of nodes seems lost.

did I misunderstand @others? Should I must have @others at
every nodes who have children nodes?

Hmm.  I'm not sure what is going on.  That structure is "carried" by the
hidden shadow file.

The first thing I do when weird things start happening is clear all Leo's
caches: clear-all-caches.  Does that help?

No.  That would be bad style because it is unnecessary.

Hi All,
 
I hope that the post takes this time.
 
I'm trying to use rst tables by using the table markup in the body text, 
with one node per table row.  However it seems that the nodes are being 
preceded with a line-feed even-though @rst-no-head is in effect.
 
Can anybody help with preventing that line-feed, it breaks the rst table

Hmm.  My guess is that a new @rst directive would be needed.  The
workaround would seem to be to put the entire table in a single node, but
presumably you have your reasons for not wanting to do that.

Feel free to file a wish-list bug.

@nocolor

From: Craig Johnson <craig@hivemind.net>




Hi All,
 
I've been creating rst tables using rst markup directly in the body text.  
For field lists.  As the same field apears in multiple programs, I would 
like to use Leo's cloning to reproduce a table row in several locations in 
the tree.  The issue that prevents me from doing this, is that an 
@rst-no-head headline seems to generate a line-feed preceeding the body 
text in the derived file which breaks the table parse.
 
Maybe a example:
The Leo tree:
 
+Program1
  +Parameters
       =================== ========
       Field Name          Format
       =================== ========
    +@rst-no-head Field1
        prmField1          Integer
 
Results in the following markup
Program1
^^^^^^^^^
Parameters
~~~~~~~~~
=================== ========
Field Name          Format
=================== ========

prmField1           Integer
That blank line in the markup before the node body text breaks the table.

No fix (sorry), but can confirm the problem -- it should go in the bug=20
list. (I looked at the rst code, and fainted)

I note that your format wouldn't work without closing the table off:=20

But you are right: @rst-no-head doesn't work properly.

Looks like you can only post process the rst intermediate file and=20
eliminate that extra line.

@nocolor

From: SegundoBob <bhossley@ieee.org>




I very recently began using the Leo-Editor spell checking facility.  
Whenever a correctly spelled word was flagged as misspelled, I hit the 
"Add" button to add the word to my dictionary.  All seemed fine till the 
next time I used Bazaar to pull the latest changes.  Then I noticed that 
"adding" a word, changed the Leo-Editor source controlled file 
leo/plugins/spellpyx.txt.

Unless I'm missing something, this is undesirable.

An ordinary Linux user who installs Leo-Editor probably does not have write 
permission for leo/plugins/spellpyx.txt.  Doesn' this mean that the "Add" 
button doesn't work for him?

For me, this problem is different.  I use the bzr-explorer diff facility to 
find the difference between my leo/plugins/spellpyx.txt and the last pulled 
version.  I then save my additions.  Then I revert 
leo/plugins/spellpyx.txt.  Then I pull the latest Leo-Editor version.  Then 
I add my additions to the latest leo/plugins/spellpyx.txt. I have 
semi-automated some of these steps with a Leo-Editor script that I execute 
with Ctrl-B.

Does anyone see a simpler procedure?

Isn't requiring users to change a file that is a Leo-Editor, 
source-controlled source file a bad idea?

@nocolor

From: Terry Brown <terry_n_brown@yahoo.com>

(This is a response to the invisible line glitch, but not directly
related, so a new thread)

Rember this:

http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/ee869a0a70f2d765

Some time ago I was working on styling Leo from a single top level
stylesheet using a mechanism similar to CSS classes, so instead of:
    
    # widget is active
    w.setStyle("QTextEdit { color: red; font-weight: bold; }")
    
    ...
    
    # widget is inactive
    w.setStyle("QTextEdit { color: black; font-weight: normal; }")
    
you'd have

    # widget is active
    w.setAttribute('active', True)
    
    ...
    
    # widget is inactive
    w.setAttribute('active', False)

and in the single global style sheet

    QTextEdit[active="true"] { color: red; font-weight: bold; }
    QTextEdit[active="false"] { color: red; font-weight: bold; }

This isn't a perfect example because if active == focused then you
could probably just use the pseudo-state :focus and let Qt do all the
work, and also Leo would .setStyle() a string defined in @settings, not
something hard coded.

Qt styles are different from CSS in that CSS has a single attribute,
`class`, which can contain a space separated list of tags, whereas Qt
has arbitrary attributes like the `active` I just made up above.

@nocolor

From: "Edward K. Ream" <edreamleo@gmail.com>

The more I think about it, the more I think Leo needs an automated playback 
capability.  I had some initial thoughts in the thread, "PyOhio Leo Video 
up on youtube", 
https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/leo-editor/nmBweM3wI3o.

There as several immediate applications for automated playback:

1. As a helper for those preparing demos of Leo.  It eliminates the need to 
think, talk and type at the same time ;-)  The hope is that the narrator 
would be more comfortable and relaxed during the recording, but perhaps 
that is wishful thinking.

2. As an automated, scripted, demo of what Leo can do.  You could even 
imagine the quickstart.leo would "create itself" when it was opened.  You 
would simply need to start the demo when the file was opened!

As I was thinking about playback, I considered how the playback would draw 
attention to various parts of the screen.  In other words, we need 
something akin to the big red arrows in the Leo slideshows. One easy way to 
do this would be with a DialogWithImage call, that would pop up a dialog 
showing, say, a magnified image of a dirty icon box.  Depending on options, 
the dialog might go away after a few seconds, or remain until the use hits 
any key.

The main question is, how easy will it be to create and edit playbacks?  
I'm not sure.  Any such playback capability would essentially be a 
(detailed!) script.  We can imagine a script that is essentially Python:  
Something like:

goto_sibling_node(<<node name>>)
dialog(<<dialog name>>,<< when dismissed>>)
edit_headline
type_individual_letters('This is the headline',<<delay between letters>>)
type_text('This is the headline')
insert_sibling_node()
insert_child_node()
select_find_tab()
etc! etc!

Leo already has most of the capability go generate this as we use Leo:  
it's the so-called "lossage" history in k.masterKeyHandler.  I'm thinking 
that there is no urgent need to capture the mouse: we might as well 
demonstrate mouseless Leo!

Actually, we might forgo capturing actions altogether, and just write the 
script directly.  We'll have to see whether that makes sense.

Your comments, please, Amigos.

Rev 5432 provides some answers.  test.leo contains the node, "Prototype of 
screencast script".  It took many hours of happy experimentation to get the 
script to work, but the results are worth all the futzing.  Here is the 
first script::

    s = p.b # This script.
    c = c.new()
    p = c.p
    p.h = ''
    n1,n2 = 0.01,0.2 # Small difference are important.
    head_keys('This is headline text',n1,n2)
    body_keys('This is some body text.\\n',0.0,0.0) # n1,n2)
    body_keys('Some more body text.\\n',0.0,0.0)
    body_keys(s,0.0,0.0)

The head_keys and body_keys (not shown) simulate typing, with a range of 
typing speed indicated by the n1 and n2 params.  The result is really fun 
to watch.  As you will see, there is a wait method that waits a variable 
number of seconds.  This will be useful in other contexts.

This is the most fun I've had in quite awhile. It's becoming clear that 
being able to generate screencasts from scripts will be an excellent tool 
for those trying to explain Leo.  Imo, creating screencasts from such 
scripts will be *much* simpler than making slideshows.

I've got lots of ideas for improvements to screencasts.  I should have 
something pretty cool to show in a week or so...

Edward

P.S.  The head_keys and body_keys methods cost me a *lot* of work.  It's 
tricky to show the typing immediately without flash.  These are the first 
of several planned helper methods for use in screencasts::

     def head_keys(s,n1=0.04,n2=0.1):
        import leo.core.leoGui as leoGui
        p = c.p
        tree = c.frame.tree
        c.editHeadline()
        w = tree.edit_widget(p)
        for ch in s:
            p.h = p.h + ch
            tree.repaint() # *not* tree.update.
            wait(n1,n2)
            event = leoGui.leoKeyEvent(c,ch,ch,w,x=0,y=0,x_root=0,y_root=0)
            c.k.masterKeyHandler(event)
        c.frame.tree.repaint()
        c.redraw()

    def body_keys(s,n1=0.04,n2=0.1):
        c.bodyWantsFocusNow()
        p = c.p
        w = c.frame.body.bodyCtrl.widget
        for ch in s:
            p.b = p.b + ch
            w.repaint()
            wait(n1,n2)
        c.redraw()

Screencasts promise to be easy to be *much* easier to create than 
slideshows, while also being more interesting, informative and flashy.  It 
is *so* much easier to write a screencast script than it is to lay out a 
slide, take a screenshot, and then manage resulting slide.

In particular, there are few continuity problems with screencasts.  
Continuity is a *huge* problem with slideshows!  If I change one slide, I 
am likely to want to change all following slides.  Which means I have to 
retake all the slides, and file the new versions in the proper places.  In 
contrast, any changes to screencasts naturally propagate forward.  There 
might be an effect on following screencasts scenes, but this will happen 
rarely with a reasonable scene design, and any problems should be easy to 
fix.

With screencasts, the *movie* script is also the *python* script!  There is 
no "translation" from one to the other.  Furthermore, all the work to 
produce a screencast is done (naturally!) within Leo.  No need to create 
and manage external data.  This is another huge advantage and it make 
producing screencasts much faster than producing slideshows.

Screencasts are likely to be the long-awaited tools that will allow me to 
show Leo in action so that other will finally be able to understand it 
easily.  This is an exciting prospect!

This seems strange. In my intuition, if you want to double the speed, the
factor should be 2.0. (use new_factor = 1.0/old_factor instead?)

But then how do you set the wait to zero? :-)

Anyway, it's a minor point: now that manual play is coming the speed factor 
will not be important.

Rev  5434 packages this into the new screencast plugin.  Yesterdays work, 
in screencast.py and the node "@command screencast @key=Alt-9" in test.leo 
taught me several things.  In the notes below, m is an instance of 
ScreenCastController.  m stands for "movie" :-)

1. It's probably best to not to open a new Leo window for screencasts.  
This avoid problems with w.repaint occurring in a another repaint 
operation, thereby freezing Leo.  This is not a major constraint: we 
typically will want to have screencasts operate on the local .leo file.

2. I spent a lot of time trying to adjust the delay between "transitions".  
The arguments to m.wait specify the range of waiting allowed.  The plugin 
multiplies these nominal factors by a **speed factor**, initially 1.0.  
m.set_speed sets this factor. To double the presentation speed, set the 
factor to 0.5.

The m.log call writes a message to the log pane, with calls to m.wait(1) 
before and after inserting the text.  Both waits are important.  The 
"opening" wait allows the user to see the effect of the previous operation; 
the "closing" wait allows the user to read the new comment in the log pane 
before the next operation happens.

3. The futzing with speed and waits convinces me that specifying waits "by 
hand" isn't good enough.  Pre-specified waits will be useful only for an 
**unattended mode** that just plays the screencast from start to finish.  
But for most presentations we want the presenter to switch from one 
**scene** of the movie to the next by hitting the RightArrow key.  The 
LeftArrow key will go back to the previous scene. Thus, in **attended 
mode**, most calls to m.wait will have no effect.  (An exception will be 
the calls to m.wait in the code the simulates a person typing in headline 
or body text.  Thus calls should always have effect, so we will have a 
"force" arg to m.wait.)

It will be relatively straightforward to do the first draft of attended 
mode.  At the programming level, it will work like any minibuffer command 
that prompts for user input.  That is, the plugin will create a so-called 
state handler for the slideshow.

At the design level,  the main idea is to treat every node under the main 
@screencast node as a scene.  This natural division allows the screencast 
to organize the material using all of Leo's organizational capabilities.

The state handler will, when seeing the RightArrow key, "play" the next 
scene merely by moving to the next node and then executing the script in 
it's body text.  This script could contain *any* Leo script, but most often 
it will call ScreenCastController methods.   Moving to the previous scene 
can be done by Leo's undo command, automatically managed by the 
ScreenCastController.  This will be a bit tricky, but not hugely so.

4. Putting comments in the log pane is ok for a prototype, but it's pretty 
lame.  Instead, I'd like to use some kind of popup that can be associated 
with individual items on the screen and located with precision relative to 
those items. The popup should be able to contain both text and graphics. 
Does anyone have a suggestion for what Qt widget to use?

Your comments please, Amigos.

Indeed it was.  Rev  5435 contains the new code in screencast.py and new 
test code in test.leo.  To run the test, just do Alt-9, then hit the right 
arrow key until done.  Escape or Ctrl-g will abort the screencast.  All 
other keys get ignored.

**Warning**: the present screen cast insert a node in a somewhat random 
location.

The code that looks for the next node assumes that if it has a script if 
p.b.strip() is True.  Before making this check, it should strip off python 
comment lines so the speaker can add comments.

There is still lots of work to be done, but already we have a fun sandbox 
to play in.  As you will see, all the code in ScreenCastController is dead 
easy, which bodes well for future work.

Sorry for the delay in responding.  Leo's body pane is a QTextBrowser:
http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qtextbrowser.html
a subclass of QTextEdit.  QTextBrowser also inherits from QFrame and
QWidget, so there *might* be a way to have a background image "leak"
through the text.

QTextEdit#richTextEdit { background-image: url('/home/tbrown/Desktop/cow2.jpg'); }

in the stylesheet gives the effect attached (i.e. it works).

If you wanted node specific backgrounds Leo would have to start setting
an attribute on the body widget, probably the gnx, so you could do

QTextEdit#richTextEdit[leo_gnx='tbrown.20130430222443.19340'] { 
  background-image: url('/home/tbrown/Desktop/cow2.jpg'); 
}

Wow!  Thanks for this.  LeoUser wrote a version of Leo in Jython (using the
Swing classes), and he claimed that he could watch *movies* in the body
pane :-)

I'll add this to the Leo/To Document list.  Not sure yet how that list is
going to get translated into action.  Still reading Getting Things Done :-)
.. @+node:ekr.20130806072439.21222: *5* Best way to synchronize/update myLeoSettings.leo and leoSettings.leo ?
From: wgw <wgwinder@gmail.com>

For the moment, I use Meld to compare/update myLeoSettings.leo file. That 
seems a bit error-prone. Is there a better way? By update, I mean that, for 
example, in the bzr copy of LeoSettings.leo, the code_wise node says :

True: use codewise completions.
False: use leo-specific completions.

This setting is no longer used!

But in my (now old) myLeoSettings.leo file it says: 

True: use codewise completions.
False: use leo-specific completions

I want to transfer that updated setting comment to myLeoSettings so that I 
don't have to refer to LeoSetttings.leo when I tweak my installation. 

Another example: the plugins list will change with new plugins or 
eliminated plugins, but those changes won't be noted in the myLeoSettings 
file. So you have to check both settings files to find/enable plugins.

In general, it would seem useful to be able to merge the two leo files 
(like bzr merge?) or somehow make note of differences in the myLeoSettings 
file. 

This is starting to sound complicated.... :) Sorry!

EKR

It is complicated.  One tiny workaround is to delete nodes from
myLeoSettings.leo if and when they become unused.  More generally, you only
have to put nodes in myLeoSettings.leo if they are different from the
defaults.  But you probably already know that :-)

Really, this is a special case of the fundamental problem the Leo
developers have been struggling with:  Leo is great for storing gobs of
data, but not so great at sharing.  As a result, everyone, including Leo's
developers, struggles to remember, access or browse all the great stuff
that is already present.

Requiring tags is no solution: it's hopeless to require volunteers to do
anything :-)  I'm not just making a joke.  Someone who contributes a script
to this Google Group is under no further obligation to somehow be
compatible with *any* other submission rules.  Somehow, it's up to me, or
the other core developers, to find a simple, reliable way of "indexing" the
submissions.  Right now I have no solutions.

From: felix74 <hjuucy@googlemail.com>

I'm trying to create a interactive chart in a embedded in a new leo pane 
using matplotlib. However, I am not sure about the the best way  to 
implement this. I would appreciate some guidance on this please? The 
questions I would like answered are:
1/ How do I create a new blank pane for embedding a chart as well as other 
QtWidgets.
2/ Can I do this in a script or do I need to work with leo source 

The context for wanting to do this is that I want to create a data 
processing and visualization tool kit in leo. Like Excel but using nodes 
instead of columns. As such I have data in nodes and can create new data 
nodes by applying python functions to data in existing nodes. The thing 
missing is the visualization within a leo pane (I can easily launch a chart 
in it's own window) .

If you were only going to have one and you weren't going to destroy it,
you could just do something simple like c._matplot = self in its
constrictor (assuming c was passed to the constructor).

If you're going to have more than one and they may be destroyed, it
might be simplest to let the free_layout / nested_splitter system manage
them.

ts = c.free_layout.get_top_splitter()
matplotters = ts.findChildren(myMatplotWidget)

should return a list of the widgets of your class in the layout, but
only if they're in the main window, widgets in extra windows opened
from the "Open window" context menu item would be missed, I can add a
find_children() method to complement the find_child() method the
splitters already have to account for this.

Detail: the above is just using Qt's QObject.findChildren(), the
nested_splitter find_child() and (not yet written) find_children()
versions search the extra windows as well.

It should probably provide a fresh myMatplotWidget every time it's
called, so don't construct one in the Provider's init, but in the
ns_provide method.

See above.

Above again :-)

The value returned by ns_provider_id should be unique for the provider
class, but constant.  So it can just return "matplotlib provider ver 1"
or something.

Would this be a good blog item?  These blog items might eventually find

Terry,
 
Thanks for your help with this it was very helpful and a lot simpler than I 
feared. I have managed to get a matplotlib graph embedded within a pane in 
leo as a widget. I now need some help with how to interact with the 
widget using scripts in leo. I am unsure about the following:
 
*1/ How do I expose the widget within th leo python environment?* 
Here I have created a self.mat in your MatplotPaneProvider class to make 
the windget accessible but it doesn't feel like the correct way to do this. 
 
from PyQt4 import QtGui
class MatplotPaneProvider:
def __init__(self, c):
     self.c = c
    * self.mat = myMatplotWidget()*
     if hasattr(c, 'free_layout'):
         splitter = c.free_layout.get_top_splitter()
     if splitter:
         splitter.register_provider(self)
    def ns_provides(self):
         return[('Add matplot', '_add_matplot_pane')]
    def ns_provide(self, id_):
         if id_ == '_add_matplot_pane':
         c = self.c
         return self.mat
 
    def ns_provider_id(self):

# used by register_provider() to unregister previously registered
# providers of the same service
# provider ID is not the same as the service id_ above
return "completely unique value here"

 
*mat = MatplotPaneProvider(c)*
*mat.mat.someMethod()*
*mat.mat.someOtherMethod()*
 
*2/I would also like to make the widget accessible from any script within 
leo. What's the leo way of doing this?*

Paste just as above and run the script.  Nothing happens.  Right click

Instead of "w = QtGui.QSlider()", you want "w = myMatplotWidget()"

@nocolor

From: <fidelperez@gmail.com>

I am going through something similar Matt Wilkie went through in this
post<https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!searchin/leo-editor/leopyref/leo-editor/pWyd5ae952I/kvxf_H-QBq4J>
.

Basically I can find interesting functions in LeoPyRef.leo but I dont know 
how to access them from my new leo scripts.

I dont get the difference when I have to call them using g.Functionname(), 
c.functionname(), or when those wont do.

How can I call the function "insertIconFromFile"?
How can I know how to call functions found in LeoPyRef.leo?

Thanks!

Ps: When I get that, I will already have a bookmarks importer from 
chrome/mozilla which will also import the icons of the links! x)
I will prepare some more interesting utils (import mindmap, etc) then 
release them together with manuals oriented to noob users.

Sounds great!
So, in the search results, will I be able to know how to call that function?
IE, if I find insertIconFromFile, will I be able to know that I can call it
through using c.editCommands.insertIconFromFile?

I suppose you could say that there is no general solution, but the
situation isn't really all that difficult.

Start with c.  We know what that is:  it is a commander object representing
an open outline.

There are **official ivars** of c, all referring to wrapper classes defined
in leoFrame.py:

c.frame: an instance of leoFrame.
c.frame.tree: an instance of  leoTree.
c.frame.body: an instance of leoBody.
c.frame.log: an instance of leoLog.

The tree, body and log objects have a *ctrl* objects, which are *wrapper*
classes:

c.frame.tree.treeCtrl
c.frame.body.bodyCtrl
c.frame.log.logCtrl

In particular, see
http://leoeditor.com/scripting.html#c-frame-body-bodyctrlfor a
description of the high-level text interface supported by all
high-level text widgets, including the log and body classes.

These wrapper classes have a widget ivar, which is a reference to the
corresponding Qt widget object.  For example::

    import PyQt4.QtGui as QtGui
    w =3D c.frame.body.bodyCtrl.widget
    g.es(w)
    g.es(isinstance(w,QtGui.QTextBrowser)

yields::

    (LeoQTextBrowser) 62418136
    True

As shown, the LeoQTextBrowser class is a real (subclass of) QTextBrowser.

HTH.  I've made a note to discuss official ivars in more detail in the
scripting chapter.

Although I still have a mess on which functions can be called how, and

I'm not aware of a general solution to the problem of finding the
various pieces of Leo's class structure.  Basically there are all these
classes defined in the source, and instances of these are attached to
each other in a hierarchical network (with loops).

I've written an introspection function which lists the methods and
instance variables (and class variables) of an arbitrary object by name
and by type.  I should release it.  It builds its lists in a Leo
outline, so you can navigate around that outline and expand nodes by
introspection as needed.

It occurs to me that the same code could be used to search Leo's
runtime object hierarchy for you, i.e. you enter 'insertIconFromFile'
and it recursively searches for it.

I didn't really finish the above para.  The problem is that it's hard
to guess what the names of the attachment points are, and the attaching
is done in a variety of places, sometimes by factory functions which
further obscure linkages.  Not a fault with Leo, just the way programs
work.  So the tool I've written may be the best approach to mapping
Leo's runtime structure. Another thing it could do, try and map 'major'
classes, or at least classes from leo.core.* - i.e. ignore the built in
types.

http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/a08d122e0cf59359/60be2b02f3ef3e94

Unfortunately, this recipe has a problem:  When focus is moved away
from and then back to the modified node, the inserted text
disappears.  That is, Leo-Editor seems unaware of the insertion.

The following recipe fixes this problem:

I think that's the way, see also:

Depending on your use you might want to
   
    oldins = w.getInsertPoint() 

    ...

    w.setInsertPoint(oldins+len(inserted_text)) 

to get the cursor where you want it afterwards, lots of variations how
the new position might be calculated.

Other possibly useful methods:

    i,j = w.getSelectionRange(sort=True)
    s = w.getSelectedText()

I don't think Leo constantly updates p.b from w.getAllText(), but just
does it when focus is lost - not sure about that though.

Here's a thought for a higher level interface.

c.get_edit_state() gives you an instance of a LeoEditState class with
these attributes:

  text attributes

  les.all_text
  les.text_before_select
  les.text_after_select
  les.selected_text
  les.text_before_cursor
  les.text_after_cursor

  integer attributes

  les.selection_start
  les.selection_end
  les.cursor_index

then you can either do

c.set_edit_state(les)

which sets the editor text and p.b to les.all_text and sets up
selection and insert position appropriately from the integers,

or c.set_edit_state(les, mode='selection')
or c.set_edit_state(les, mode='cursor')

which assembles things based on the selection or cursor text attributes.

Thoughts?  So long since I wrote any emacs text manipulation stuff I
can't remember the idiom it used.

Cheers -Terry

Your workflow make sense for the general case of doing any arbitrary
thing with Leo.  For the specific case of manipulating text, I think
the API could be improved, or, seeing the existing API make sense for
what it is, we could have additional "easy text manipulation" API.
So long since I used Emacs I can't really remember its model, and if it

@nocolor

From: <lzyerste@gmail.com>

If I want to use leo to make mathematical notes, how can I type in some
special mathematical sysbols? Or is there a good way to make mathematical
notes using leo?

===== Terry

I use itex2MML with reStructuredText.  So within Leo you're looking at
LaTeX math markup, and you get outputs in PDF and XHTML, with MathML in
the latter.

===== <jose.i.rojas@gmail.com>

I've been doing this for about a year now.  I use the math docutils 
directive.  A custom .XCompose file (for example: 
https://github.com/kragen/xcompose)  also helps.

===== Terry

I think math was added to docutils after I started using itex2mml,
neater to use docutils built in math now I think.

Although having said that, playing with docutils math a bit suggests
itex2mml gives more complete support for both MathMML and perhaps LaTeX
math (with the PDF target).

===== jose

Terry, your setup is probably more flexible, but I haven't had any problems with 
docutils math. It seems to support all the syntax that I've found necessary.

I forgot to mention that the viewrendered plug-in doesn't display math 
correctly.  I'm not sure what the problem is, I remember trying to figure 
it out a while back, but I never got anywhere.  It's not really a big 
problem though, I have scripts to compile nodes to html/pdfs and open them 
in firefox/pdf reader; math works fine that way.

===== From: offray@riseup.net

Is not properly Leo, but is python related, tailored for math and with a
web interface and has leo bindings, check Ipython:

http://ipython.org/

I'm using it for all my math related writing and I think that point the
future of interactive writing in Python. I dream of a body pane on leo
with the features of the pyton qt console.

Just pushed leo/external/leoftsindex.py:

Stand alone GUI free index builder for Leo's full text search system::

  python leoftsindex.py <file1> <file2> <file3>...

If <file> does not contain '#' it's assumed to be a .leo file
to index, and is indexed.

If <file> does contain '#' it's assumed to be a .leo file
containing a list of .leo files to index, with the list in
the node indicated by the UNL after the #, e.g.::

   path/to/myfile.leo#Lists-->List of outlines

In the latter case, if the node identified by the UNL has children,
the list of files to scan is built from the first line of the body
of each child node of the identified node (works well with bookmarks.py).
If the node identified by the UNL does not have children, the
node's body is assumed to be a simple text listing of paths to .leo files).

note::
    
    It may be necessary to quote the "file" on the command line,
    as the '#' may be interpreted as a comment delimiter::

Often, I find myself wanting to execute system commands in serial fashion

I'd like to show stderr and stdout in g.es, or separate log page, and

I tried more direct communication (subprocess.Popen.communicate())
before the screen approach, it's hard and probably app. specific.
leoscreen avoids that by basically being interactive, so it might not
be a fit for your case.  Basically it's leveraging the intelligence of
the user to keep track of execution.

From: "Ville M. Vainio" <vivainio@gmail.com>

--089e013a01e8654f3004da94b044


Now I have basic functionality pushed to trunk.

If you want to "spawn" (posibbly several) system commands to background,
use g.procs.add(), like this ctrl+b script:

def L(*args):
    g.es("callback", args)

g.procs.add(['sleep', '4'], "que1")
g.procs.add(['sleep', '3'], "que1", L)
g.procs.add(['sleep', '2'], "que1")
g.procs.add(['sleep', '2'], "que2")

Note how que2 completes first. Idea is that commands in same queue depend
on each other, and thus need to run in sequential order.

This should make waiting for long lasting operations easier as the whole
Leo won't freeze until they are over (but you can still use the stdout /
stderr output from these calls, thanks to the optional callback)

API may change once I start using it (soon).

There's the leoscreen stuff for integration with the GNU `screen`
terminal switcher / manager.  Push lines from the body to the terminal,
pull lines back the other way.  But more for interactive interaction
with terminal programs than batch oriented work.  Leo doesn't block.

From: =?UTF-8?Q?Jo=C3=A3o_Alexandre_Toledo?= <jalexandretoledo@gmail.com>

As I use Leo to write PL/SQL code, I need to write similar text several=20
times, changing only small parts of it. It would be great if I could create=
=20
a node with the "template" and then clone it everywhere it should be=20
written, and then providing the parameters to be used in this writing.

Let me try to clarify it. I'd like to create a tree like this:

 +- @file something.sql
           +- Section 1
              + << Clone >> with Parameters A, B
           +- Section 2
              + << Clone >> with Parameters C, D

In this tree, both "Clone" nodes would be generated from a template=20
specified somewhere in the tree, and would have parts of its text replaced=
=20
with values "A" and "B" in Section 1, and "C" and "D" in Section 2.

I've searched but couldn't find anything like this, then I've thought of=20
trying to write a hook to intercept the "save" command, but couldn't think=
=20
of a way to pass the parameters; I think the obvious way would be to put=20
the parameters after the "<< >>", but then all cloned nodes are changed, so=
=20
it wouldn't work.

Another alternative would be creating some kind of directive @something,=20
but I have no idea of how to do that.

Any ideas?

I know a programming IDE <http://sourceforge.net/projects/doublesvsoop/>whi=
ch bases its existence in that concept:

You write "code Masks" and whenever you call a piece of code it will ask=20
only for the parameters, and write the rest of the code. There are already=
=20
some languages with most of the masks (all the primary functions and some=
=20
complex ones) and its growing.

For instance, if you write:

"window" it will add the window to the code and let you edit the params.

Their functionality would be awesome in Leo and when I know a bit better I=
=20
will try to emulate on it.
Sticking to Leo tho since it has a much superior way of managing data.

I suspect different people have different things in mind when they talk
about templates.

Leo's abbreviation system is already quite advanced when it comes to
filling in skeletons of common code layouts.  I type

  def;;

and I get

  def foo(this, that=3D3):
      """foo - Return=20
 =20
      :Parameters:
      - `this`: <|describe this|>
      - `that`: <|describe that|>
      """
 =20
      <|code|>

Two "parameters" are interactively requested, the function name, and
the list of arguments.  The node name is presented as the default for
the function name, and 'self' is included in the list of arguments, so,
assuming the node was already called 'foo', all I type is this, that=3D3.
The layout above is the rst form of the epydoc/sphinx docstring with
formally identified parameters.

The cursor is positioned after Return, where the was an empty <||>
placeholder.  Pressing ,, selects the next placeholder so that typing
replaces it.

There's more, see
https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=3D#!topic/leo-editor/5ni2PwfmBz=
8
and the screencast linked from there
http://www.greygreen.org/tmp/leoabbrev.ogv=20

Other people, Jacob etc. I think, have been talking about templates
where the input parameters are stored in the outline, allowing for
some of them to be altered and the template generation step re-run.
More like generating a website from data etc.

Cheers -Terry

Variants of this seem to be wanted by many people.  Most recently, there is
the thread, "Templates with macro expansions",
https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=3D#!topic/leo-editor/nF2lUEUtaU=

Does that do what you want?

Hi,

I've tried it and it's great, I think it will be useful, but it's not what=
=20
I was thinking of...=20

Let me try to explain what I had tougth about... What I would like to do is=
:

 1. create a new .leo file
 2. add a "template" node (eventually with sub nodes) with some ${schema}=
=20
and ${table} macro place holders in its contents
 3. add a @file node to the .leo file
 4. add to this @file node a new one with definitions such as=20
schema=3DSCHEMA_NAME and table=3DTABLE_NAME
 5. add as a sub node to this last one a clone from the "template" node;
 6. then, when I save everything, the @file would have "SCHEMA_NAME" and=20
"TABLE_NAME" everywhere a "${schema}" or a "${table}" were in the original=
=20
template node.

It would be important that, when I reopen the .leo file later, the macros=
=20
in the @file node where shown as ${schema} and ${table}, and not as it's=20
substituted text.

Now that I've described it, I can't see how it would be done... The=20
${macro} place holders should be on the contents of the @file node, so=20
after substitution, how could we recover it?

That's also why the code from Jacob is not what I need (but I'm already=20
thinking of other uses for it :) ): it will create a text when the button=
=20
is pressed, but the generated nodes will be just static text.


Thank you all.=20

Leo is great!

I don't have any visual indication of the existence of @rclick nodes,
it would be nice.

Something I've found useful is adding a @click node like:
@rclick -------------

that separates my entries from the ever present
'Remove Button' and 'Goto Script' entries

One more thing.  It's reasonable to have the top-level button just be a
placeholder for subsidiary @rclick nodes.  To do that without getting a
warning when clicking the top-level button, set its script to "empty

:) It's in the core, not context_menu.py.  It was a long time ago, but
I remember finding the @button code tricky, so I'm not sure if it's an
ideal implementation.  OTOH it hasn't broken for 1-2 years.

Thanks.  I could have sworn I searched Leo's core for @rclick.  Must have
been a searching failure :-)  The code is in
qtIconBarClass.setCommandForButton.

I'll add documentation for this, in leoSettings.leo and also in the

.. @+node:ekr.20130806072439.21200: *5* the workflow of write leo scripts?
@nocolor

From: HaveF <iamaplayer@gmail.com>

I have read the scripting chapter of leo-editor, and already make my daily
life easier with these quick dirty, but useful scripts.

And I just want to know your workflow of writing leo scripts.

My workflow is like this
[e.g., I want to select some text in the body and make transform, then
insert to the body again]:

1. Abstract the action of word.
[in this case, I choose "select" and "insert" as my key words]

2. search the words at http://leoeditor.com/scripting.html see if there is
existing some related topics.
[I have luck to find
i = w.getInsertPoint()              # Return the location of the cursor.
...
i,j = w.getSelectionRange(sort=True)
...
s = w.getSelectedText()             # Return the selected text, if any.
]

3. but I still don't know how to insert the text to body. So I search the
above function names in the scripts.leo to see the code.
[ I find in
scripts.leo#Scripts-->@thin leoScripts.txt-->Text editing scripts-->insert
begin/endUpdate
...
w.insert(i,s1+'\\n\\t\\t\\n'+s2)
...
seems to help
]

4. test the scripts to see if it works, if it doesn't work, go to 3, to
find more example code.

Any suggestion to improve this workflow?

The script below is a tool for diffing two Leo files. The attached
screenshot illustrates the output for two different revisions of
LeoPyRef.leo.

``- nodename``
    indicates a node which disappeared
``+ nodename``
    a node which is new,
``!v nodename`` followed by ``!^ nodename``
    a node with an unchanged heading but changed content, the first
    linking to the old version, the second linking to the new version

If you have the bookmarks.py plugin active, you can double click nodes
to jump to the original(s).

Hi Terry,

I tried this one and it seems to be very useful. What I would also like to 
have is a similar (or the same) script,
that does the same on two different nodes of a leo file. I admit, the 
changes should be minimal to be done by
myself, but as I'm not familiar with the internal leo api, I wanted to ask 
for how to best do this changes.

Probably somewhere here
"""

vf = from_c.hiddenRootNode 
vt = to_c.hiddenRootNode
...
"""
just to feed in the 2 nodes, Any quick idea how this can be done the best 
way?

Rickard,

Very interesting--I'm happy to see someone thinking about how to make 
understanding code bases easier.  (I'm a rather old wannabee programmer, so 
I'm not sure it will ever be of much use to me, nor that I can offer cogent 
comments.)

I will add some comments or questions anyway: ;-)

   * Are you familiar with the concept of literate programming as espoused by 
Donald Knuth and others?  If so, did that influence you at all, and, if so 
how?  (Not that I think literate programming is the way forward, although I 
like the concept and have experimented with it--I once wrote a rather large 
Visual Basic (I know, what can I say, I was stuck in the Microsoft world at 
the time) program using a literate programming approach.  I got it working to 
a degree, but eventually had to devote more time to other things so never got 
it fully up to spec.

   * Darn, I know I had another comment, but I won't remember it until 
sometime after I hit "send" ;-)

The main purpose of my email is to encourage you--anything that can improve 
the understanding of a code base is a good thing--thanks for your efforts!

Thank you. Glad you find it interesting.

Yes. I've read about literate programming and also tried it. I found that it
didn't work so well for me for the following reasons (At least that's what I
remember. It was many years since I tried.):

* Focus on text first instead of code made it harder for me to produce working
  code. I sometimes learn how to do something by trying it out and then
  refactor the solution.

* Unless you read the PDF (or whatever the final output is) you loose the
  structure. At least I did. It was just one big file with all kinds of things
  mixed together. An outline structure solves this problem.

It influenced me mostly in that I started to think about how to best present
programs so that humans can understand them. I'm not sure literate programming
like Knuth uses it is the best way (in particular, I think the programs are
harder to modify), but I also think that a folder with just source code is not
so good either.

Nice article Rickard, I think it captures the background problem well.

I'm not sure the images communicate clones effectively -- but don't really
have an alternative suggestion that would be an improvement. It's just
really hard to appreciate how well they work without experiencing them!

Interesting - the python web application framework Django is really
tough in that regard, you might simultaneously want to work on python,
html template, css, java-script, url-dispatch, tests, model definitions.
In fact I've just made some updates to the bookmarks display plugin
which make using it effectively smoother, for a mouse user, anyway, to
help with this.  Will push them soon.

.. @+node:ekr.20130806072439.21496: *5* Leo as PIM and authoring tool
Josef <joe_da@gmx.net>
7/30/12
		
Recently I evaluated docear - a mind-mapping tool for collecting reference
data (written in Java). It automatically extracts bookmarks and annotations
from PDF files, and more, but it's support for authoring is still not up to
the task. I think it would be great if Leo could do some of the tasks
docear is doing.

Leo is primarily a literate programming editor, but also quite good at
organizing bits of information. Dragging a PDF into Leo currently just
creates an url to the PDF. This could be expanded to also extract data
(bookmarks, notes) from the PDF and to sync this data between Leo and the
PDF. This info could be placed in child nodes: bookmarks and notes could
even jump directly to the page in the PDF (although each PDF viewer seems
to have a different syntax for doing that). This would be a great way to
organize data sheets and specifications stemming from external sources.

Combining the above with an improved LaTeX support, one would get a very
powerful research and authoring tool - in my opinion with a much more
convenient interface than docear.

Perhaps it is too much work to duplicate all the work docear is doing. An
alternative may be to sync data somehow between docear and Leo. Docear
stores the data in a freeplane mind-map. Has anyone else thoughts about
this? Offray Vladimir Luna Cárdenas offray@riseup.net via googlegroups.com

I have been using Leo to write my thesis. I didn't know about Docear, but
my use was in some sense similar. I have a lot of @url links pointint to
the pdfs files and in a subtree I cut and paste the text of the pdf I want
to comment and made the comments inside the tree. These pdf were part of my
bibliographic entries and I'm now writing a .bib file for these, so I can
have in only one Leo tree all my thesis, with all the references to
external files and the annotations and bibtex entries for them. For me the
key point of Leo in academic writing is the tree view plus the clones and
ignore nodes. My thesis can have several layers, the external ones being
the actual writing and the deeper ones the references, texts, images, tools
that enable me to do that writing. Using clones and @rst-no-head directives
I can have the level of granularity of a paragraph, something that is not
possible on traditional word processor which are the writing tool of tools
like docear. This approach have some glitches:

* I still need to do some fine tunning to the LaTeX export for writing the
pdf as I want. I imagine that putting sphinx in the tool chain could change
that.

* I can not get much people of my companions using this advangages, besides
of myself, because of the difficult installation process of Leo in
Windows/Mac and the not so friendly interface for non-programmers. Other
light markup structured text writing programs like Nested[1] are more
easily used and understood despite of not having all the advantages and
flexibility of Leo.

So, in resume, may be the better approach is connecting Leo to Docear, so
you can have the advantages of both in terms of easy multiplataform
installation and friendly interface of the later and programmability,
flexibility and deeper organic structure of the former.

I would describe it as an general purpose outline that's very good at
editing code.

I'm not really sure how notes get embedded in PDFs.  As an aside, there
is also capability for using Leo to manage bookmarks to web pages, with
notes, tags, and snippets.  Look at the mod_http plugin.  It uses a
javascript bookmark button in your browser to communicate with Leo.

Syncing between the two sounds a little cumbersome to me.  I wonder if
the PDF stuff could be integrated with some sort of BibTeX .bib file
management?

Do you really need the mindmap UI of docear?  I used to use Freemind
which has a very similar interface, but switched to Leo.  I like what
http://cmap.ihmc.us/ does, but it only does idea organization, no
authoring etc.  To me cmaptools is better at idea organizing than
mindmaps.

There is also the backlinks plugin for Leo, which allows arbitrary
networks of links instead of just the directed tree, and graphcanvas,
which allows graph layout of nodes.  There aren't comparable with the
mindmap layouts, but they head in that direction.  Also note Leo's
hidden UI flexibility in the context menus on the pane dividers, you
can open a new window for the graphcanvas plugin, which gives it much
needed screen real estate.

no, I do not need the mindmap stuff at all. I had a look at short look at
cmaptools, and I agree the generalized graph approach seems better than a
standard mindmap. But I am quite happy with the tree view in Leo and as you
already mentioned, this can be extended with backlinks etc. I have used Leo
already to organize reference documents and write documentation (using
Latex).

What I do want is links to a particular page of a PDF - links to just a
file are not enough when you refer to documents with 100+ pages.
Unfortunately this seems to be difficult to achieve in a cross-platform
way, particular when trying to support different PDF viewers. Docear is
solving this (and other compatibility problems) by developing its own
integrated viewer (I do not suggest to do this for Leo).

On second thought, I don't think that extracting the bookmark and
annotation info is really important to me - I would keep that info in the
PDF, anyhow. I would write inside Leo addional notes, and the output text
(in Latex).

Some integration of Bibtex may be a good thing and needs to be thought out
- perhaps by using JabRef for this, or by recycling some pyBibliographer
code, but this is also low on my priority list.

Offray seems to have a very similar use case as I - although I do not write
a thesis, but specifications for scientific instruments. The point about
cross-platform installation ease is also well taken, so I will look into
some inter-operability here (either with docear or cmaptools). I see Leo
mainly as a personal project / information manager: the leo tree is not
easily shared with others, while the files Leo points to with @url, @auto,
@file etc can be shared quite easily. In this I use Leo as *my personal*
view on the project.

It seems that e.g. w/ foxit reader, you can open selected page from command
line (-n 123). Abstracting this for other pdf readers that support such a
thing should be no problem.

Yes, I suppose one could translate from a canonical representation inside
Leo to whatever the tool needs (using @setting). Ideally, one would even
have a choice between opening the new page in a different or in the same
PDF viewer instance as the last page, but few viewers support that (Okular
does - but I don't know any cross-platform solution).
.. @+node:ekr.20130806072439.21497: *5* persistent state with json as a leo abbreviation
From: Terry Brown <terry_n_brown@yahoo.com>

I've added an abbreviation to my myLeoSettings.leo abbreviations:
https://gist.github.com/tbnorth/5530059

It's the abbreviation "persist;;" and when you type that you get:

---cut here---
import json

json_state_file = "cache_info_file.json"
if not os.path.exists(json_state_file):
    json.dump({'cache_items':{}}, open(json_state_file, 'w'))
cache_info = json.load(open(json_state_file))

def main():

    # do stuff with cache_info...

if __name__ == '__main__':

    try:
        main()
    except:
        json.dump(cache_info, open(json_state_file, 'w'))
---cut here---

with appropriate interaction to customize all the parts which, in the
above example, include "cache_", i.e. the filename and the variable
name.

The point is it seems silly to create a module and hence a dependency
for what is barely 4 lines of actual code, but those 4 lines give you
very handy robust persistence, so something like an editor abbreviation
is the obvious way to make the available - nothing Leo specific here,
except that only serious editors have abbreviation like that ;-).

The corrected version is below for reference - I had `except` instead
of `finally` in the first version, so you data was only saved if
something went wrong :-)

It's just a framework for providing a dictionary the contents of which
persist between runs of the program.  I've used it for code that's
making lots of small url requests against a server, to cache the
results so that during development the crash / debug / re-run cycle is
faster because each piece of data is requested only once, ever, not once
every run.  More recently I was using it to store key value pairs of
filenames and a comment on the issue in the file, knowing that
completing the analysis of the issues in the files would take more than
one run of the program which was identifying the issues.

So in the example below, the content of the cache_info dictionary is
persistent, whatever main() does with it is seen next time the
program's run.  Nothing Leo specific except that it's really just an
import statement plus 5 lines of code and doesn't seem worth its own
file, but is more than you want to re-type all the time either, so
ideal for an abbreviation in your favorite editor.

I've added a couple of comments in the version below.

Cheers -Terry

# name for persistent data store

My present thinking is that such tidbits will be lost unless they get put

I have a Leo/To be documented mail folder, and this message is going there

I'm slowly trying to grok leo. I love meld, it's simply the best text

Useful!

For fun (and perhaps of some use), here is a brute compare of trees. I use

From: <fidelperez@gmail.com>

This is my first post on this group, as I discovered your software only 
yesterday, but I am already migrating all my data, weblinks, etc, to it. 
Love it.

I found it because I was planning on programming something similar (by far 
more primitive of course), but *luckily* I found it just while I was 
starting with my first steps. What I also mean by this is its a rather 
difficult software to find by non programer users who could also greatly 
benefit from it. Im so glad I found it.

The main reason for me wanting a tool which can track different types of 
information (images, videos, etc), is to make such a program able not only 
to track the information just in the way I like it, but to also operate 
with it avoiding repetitive tasks for me.

Thanks for your software, Im really excited to have found it.

From: Terry <webtourist@gmail.com>

I need to present to people who don't have leo installation, in easily 
readable format, the full content of a .leo file, not just the outline, but 
all nodes and all contents.

What do I need to do ?

===== Terry

You could run this script (below):

It only exports selected nodes, so if you want to export everything,
you have to select all the top level nodes, i.e. collapse all the nodes
so only the top level is visible, click the first one, and shift-click
the last one.

It exports to plain text... although you might be able to use the
template to describe HTML, not sure.

> Terry, how do i run it ?  I'm guessing it's not at the cmdline like "python 
> this_script.py" 

Right.  Paste the content into a node, then click the script-button
button to create a new button for running this script.  The button's
name will be the node's name, what it is doesn't matter but 'export'
would be an obvious choice.  Then select the node(s) you want exported
- presumably not including the node containing the script :)

Then it will ask for a file name and whether to include unexpanded
nodes.\

From: Miles Fidelman <mfidelman@meetinghouse.net>

A big Leo fan pointed me at Leo, and this group - indicated that sharing 
Leo documents has been talked about over the years, but not really 
implemented, and suggested that I post some details about a project that 
I've been working on.  So....

Basic model is synchronized copies of documents, linked by an asynchronous 
pub-sub channel.  Think of a personal Wiki (like TiddlyWiki) - linked to 
copies of itself, that's the general idea.  Compose a document, email 
copies to collaborators, everyone saves a local copy - those copies link to 
each other via a pub-sub protocol to distribute updates.  All in 
JavaScript, embedded in the "smart documents" - nothing special to install.

If you're interested, details are at:
http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1947703258/smart-notebooks-keeping-on-the-same-page-across-th
and Andy Oram wrote a background piece for O'Reilly Radar, at:

My apologies for not responding sooner.  That was really unfortunate.  In
my experience, the best way to ruin good ideas is to ignore them :-(

As you may have gathered, I've been overwhelmed with good ideas, bugs that
should have been fixed years ago, sometimes pathetic or non-existent
documentation.  I'm getting less overwhelmed, but I won't be able to follow
up on this idea for now.

I encourage some of Leo's more web-aware users to take a look at this. For
now, I just have to file this under Leo/Ideas :-)
.. @+node:ekr.20130806072439.21204: *5* Comparison leo outline type with other outliner's types?
From: Todd Mars <tamnt54@gmail.com>

I remember reading -somewhere- about comparing various multi-parent or
multi-copy of node outline types (clones vs. backlinks or whatever) but I
can't find where I read that. Where is it? Desire to read analysis, isn't
that in the leo docs somewhere?

Terry

Personally I think Leo could navigate cyclic graphs, see
http://leo.zwiki.org/GraphsInTrees particularly the 'Older notes' section
towards the end. But it's a major issue with regard to all the algorithms
which don't expect to run in to loops. And the extra layer of connections
from the backlinks plugin allows the same functionality, so it may be that
it's more an interface issue than a data model issue.

I'd like Leo to be able to behave like CmapTools, http://cmap.ihmc.us/ but
maybe it can, essentially, and it's really a matter of defining some new
interface bells and whistle's.
.. @+node:ekr.20130806072439.21241: *5* Free range body editors
From: Terry Brown <terry_n_brown@yahoo.com>

I suspect that if body editors could be made just slightly more
flexible it would open up whole new ways of using Leo.  It seems they
just need two or three things to make them really flexible.

- a flag to indicate whether the tree pane should select the body
    editor's node when the body editor is focused.  To see an
    example of editing bodies without the tree selecting the node you're
    editing, see the stickynotes plugin

 - a flag to indicate whether the body editor should track the node
   currently selected in the tree

 - it needs to not care about what it's contained in, GUI wise.  I
   don't know how much work's involved in this.

I'll try and contribute to things moving in this direction when I have
time, just throwing it out there for others to think on.

If you could have a body editor edit the node indicated by an UNL, it
would basically be a clone...

.. @+node:ekr.20130806072439.21248: *5* Idea/needed: system command queue
From: "Ville M. Vainio" <vivainio@gmail.com>

Often, I find myself wanting to execute system commands in serial fashion
(first in, first out), capture their output, and allow browsing it, BUT not
blocking Leo or ipython terminal.

I'd like to show stderr and stdout in g.es, or separate log page, and
provide callback after task has been completed.

Unless anyone has something like this already, I plan to create it "later"
with QProcess.

===== Ville

Now I have basic functionality pushed to trunk.

If you want to "spawn" (posibbly several) system commands to background,
use g.procs.add(), like this ctrl+b script:

def L(*args):
    g.es("callback", args)

g.procs.add(['sleep', '4'], "que1")
g.procs.add(['sleep', '3'], "que1", L)
g.procs.add(['sleep', '2'], "que1")
g.procs.add(['sleep', '2'], "que2")

Note how que2 completes first. Idea is that commands in same queue depend
on each other, and thus need to run in sequential order.

This should make waiting for long lasting operations easier as the whole
Leo won't freeze until they are over (but you can still use the stdout /
stderr output from these calls, thanks to the optional callback)

API may change once I start using it (soon).

===== Terry

There's the leoscreen stuff for integration with the GNU `screen`
terminal switcher / manager.  Push lines from the body to the terminal,
pull lines back the other way.  But more for interactive interaction
with terminal programs than batch oriented work.  Leo doesn't block.

===== Ville

A challenge I can imagine with the "screen" workflow is detecting when a
command has been executed (and capturing stderr/stdout). Do you have a
solution for that in mind?

===== Terry

I tried more direct communication (subprocess.Popen.communicate())
before the screen approach, it's hard and probably app. specific.
leoscreen avoids that by basically being interactive, so it might not
be a fit for your case.  Basically it's leveraging the intelligence of
the user to keep track of execution.
.. @+node:ekr.20130806072439.21254: *5* Idea: easy key bindings
From: "Ville M. Vainio" <vivainio@gmail.com>

Problem: I find myself repeating a bunch of alt-x commands in the same
document. There is more than one, so ctrl-p (repeat last command) is not
useful.

Idea: specify that keys from alt-1 to alt-9 are "easy macro keys". They
would be easy to bind to various alt-x command without editing preferences.

How they can be bound:

Do e.g. alt-x ipython-exec

BUT instead of pressing ENTER in the end, press alt-1. This would bind the
command to alt-1.

Store them it c.db, so they will be remembered for every leo document, but
won't clutter bindings of other people editing the same file.

===== Matt

From: Matt Wilkie <maphew@gmail.com>

I often find myself in the same situation with regards to clipboards. If
alt-# were macros, ctrl-# could be clipboards perhaps?

It could be even more important then to have some sort UI method for
inspecting/previewing the contents of them. Maybe thumbnail preview a la
Sublime's right hand document overview.

===== Fidel

I am still studying (and have much more to study yet) Leo, but I think that 
two things can be archieved by integrating it with libraries like pywinauto 
<https://code.google.com/p/pywinauto/> or
dragonfly<https://code.google.com/p/dragonfly/>


- First of all, it could track all the keystrokes of the user, relate it to
  the window, then offer the user possibility to repeat (even complex
  sequences)

- Second, It would be great to have a Leo tab with buttons showing the
  hotkeys related to the current action (IE when the user has the cursor on
  a node, or the edit pane, etc) (or even the current window in front). So
  when the user uses those hotkeys, Leo will track them, so the next
  scenario could happen:

User copyes a link from Leo
User sets an excel file to front
User pastes it in an excel cell and hits down.

If both the user did those through hotkeys, and they were tracked, Leo 
could automatically offer repeat the same action with the next links held 
in the same category.

This is a pretty raw explanation but I hope it makes the point. 
Nevertheless, I will continue to study, research and try to help with those 
features by myself.

I've been blind all these years!  @nosent should put headlines as nodes a 
comments.  They would be very useful and I can see no reason not to put 
such comments.  If, for some reason, they are not desired, you could use 
@asis.

===== Ville

I use @nosent for non-code text mostly, and it's not clear what "comment"
should mean in that context.

I for sure would like this kind of feature, but sometimes I'd like to have
the headlines written as reST style headlines (underlines), etc.

So this is not a complete no-brainer modification.

===== EKR

I agree.  Some more thought is needed.

===== Ville

Instead of changing how Leo fundamentally behaves (@nosent is part of
that), how about adding a new @directive that allows things like this? E.g.
"@write a.txt" would be nice & "obvious".

===== EKR

In this case, adding support for a new directive might be more complicated
than changing @nosent :-)


.. @+node:ekr.20130806072439.21370: *5* Parameterized template nodes
From: Alexandre_Toledo?= <jalexandretoledo@gmail.com>

As I use Leo to write PL/SQL code, I need to write similar text several
times, changing only small parts of it. It would be great if I could create
a node with the "template" and then clone it everywhere it should be
written, and then providing the parameters to be used in this writing.

Let me try to clarify it. I'd like to create a tree like this:

 +- @file something.sql
           +- Section 1
              + << Clone >> with Parameters A, B
           +- Section 2
              + << Clone >> with Parameters C, D

In this tree, both "Clone" nodes would be generated from a template
specified somewhere in the tree, and would have parts of its text replaced
with values "A" and "B" in Section 1, and "C" and "D" in Section 2.

I've searched but couldn't find anything like this, then I've thought of
trying to write a hook to intercept the "save" command, but couldn't think
of a way to pass the parameters; I think the obvious way would be to put
the parameters after the "<< >>", but then all cloned nodes are changed, so
it wouldn't work.

Another alternative would be creating some kind of directive @something,
but I have no idea of how to do that.

Any ideas?

===== EKR

Variants of this seem to be wanted by many people.  Most recently, there is
the thread, "Templates with macro expansions",
https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=3D#!topic/leo-editor/nF2lUEUtaUE

Does that do what you want?

I know a programming IDE
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/doublesvsoop/>which bases its existence in
that concept:

You write "code Masks" and whenever you call a piece of code it will ask
only for the parameters, and write the rest of the code. There are already
some languages with most of the masks (all the primary functions and some
complex ones) and its growing.

For instance, if you write:

"window" it will add the window to the code and let you edit the params.

Their functionality would be awesome in Leo and when I know a bit better I
will try to emulate on it. Sticking to Leo tho since it has a much superior
way of managing data.

I suspect different people have different things in mind when they talk
about templates.

Leo's abbreviation system is already quite advanced when it comes to
filling in skeletons of common code layouts.  I type

  def;;

and I get

  def foo(this, that=3D3):
      """foo - Return
 
      :Parameters:
      - `this`: <|describe this|>
      - `that`: <|describe that|>
      """
 
      <|code|>

Two "parameters" are interactively requested, the function name, and
the list of arguments.  The node name is presented as the default for
the function name, and 'self' is included in the list of arguments, so,
assuming the node was already called 'foo', all I type is this, that=3D3.
The layout above is the rst form of the epydoc/sphinx docstring with
formally identified parameters.

The cursor is positioned after Return, where the was an empty <||>
placeholder.  Pressing ,, selects the next placeholder so that typing
replaces it.

There's more, see
https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=3D#!topic/leo-editor/5ni2PwfmBz8
and the screencast linked from there
http://www.greygreen.org/tmp/leoabbrev.ogv

Other people, Jacob etc. I think, have been talking about templates
where the input parameters are stored in the outline, allowing for
some of them to be altered and the template generation step re-run.
More like generating a website from data etc.

@nocolor

From: <jalexandretoledo@gmail.com>

I've tried it and it's great, I think it will be useful, but it's not what
I was thinking of...

Let me try to explain what I had tougth about... What I would like to do is:

 1. create a new .leo file
 2. add a "template" node (eventually with sub nodes) with some ${schema}
and ${table} macro place holders in its contents
 3. add a @file node to the .leo file
 4. add to this @file node a new one with definitions such as
schema=3DSCHEMA_NAME and table=3DTABLE_NAME
 5. add as a sub node to this last one a clone from the "template" node;
 6. then, when I save everything, the @file would have "SCHEMA_NAME" and
"TABLE_NAME" everywhere a "${schema}" or a "${table}" were in the original
template node.

It would be important that, when I reopen the .leo file later, the macros
in the @file node where shown as ${schema} and ${table}, and not as it's
substituted text.

Now that I've described it, I can't see how it would be done... The
${macro} place holders should be on the contents of the @file node, so
after substitution, how could we recover it?

That's also why the code from Jacob is not what I need (but I'm already
thinking of other uses for it :) ): it will create a text when the button
is pressed, but the generated nodes will be just static text.

How could we  treat leo tree as flat, contiguous memory structure (something that's easy to memcpy, pass as shared memory or flush to disk in one write)?

Some ideas could be: 

- Use Redis to store tree
- Keep the "clean" body texts in contiguous block (most bodies will always be clean), append dirty (modified) body texts after it
- Keeping the outline structure in memory block is quite easy, since there is not a lot of data. You could have just a list of [parent, child] id's or whatever

Many thanks for this link. Here are some first thoughts.

Focusing on performance can *never* create a design like Light Table
;-)  That's reason enough to put aside all concerns about performance
except for caching issues and true performance bugs.

Here is what I particularly like about Light Table:

1. The unit of programming is the node/function.

Without sentinels.

2. There are naturally multiple nodes on the screen.

Without the add-editor and delete-editor commands.

3. It's easy to see all the functions called from a function.

Without having to explicitly organize nodes so that helpers are children.

4. Searching creates nodes/editors automatically.

Without the clone-find-all commands.

All of these things would be good to add to Leo. Conceivably, this set
of capabilities could even replace Leo, but Leo adds some other
features that this scheme can't provide:

1. Structure is always visible.

Light Table has no notion of organization.

2. Leo's DOM has no meaning in Light Table.

Traversals don't exist in Light Table.  Nodes have neither headlines
nor attributes.

We can prototype these features in Leo as follows:

A. Create commands that will show related nodes:
show-called-functions, show-caller-functions, etc. These could take
their "search pattern" from the selected text.

B. More generally, we could create new searches could take their
search pattern from the selected text, and another set of searches
that would return a list of nodes, perhaps as a generalization of
clone-find-all.

C. Create commands that show multiple nodes in multiple body editors
without explicitly having to create and destroy body editors.  This
could be called the "Sea of Nodes" view, and the recent Aha about
supporting multiple sets of links would allow us to create links in
various "Sea" views while retaining the overall structured view.

D. More speculatively, one could imagine tagging or other schemes that
would eliminate the need for an "official" structure, and thus node
sentinels.  However, this would destroy Leo's DOM, so I think it's
likely that Ville is correct when he says that Leo will always have
sentinels ;-)

In short, the "refulgent" way is worth stealing ;-)

Your thoughts please, Amigos.

P.S. I don't understand the notion of values "flowing" through a
program, so I haven't picked up on it here.  Ditto for the notion of
instant execution.  That doesn't mean they aren't important.

I think this is about the feature/idea where the right hand panel
shows the values produced by the function on the left, instantly with
no save and execute command needed from the user.  In Leo terms this
might be like the script or unit tests always running, no [ctrl-B] or
[Alt-F4] needed, with the additional ability of seeing the contents of
each variable in real time (e.g. no need to insert `print(foo)` ).

I find the prospect very exciting as that is one of the hardest parts
for me, remembering or recalculating mentally what the results of the
thing I'm working on are at any given point in the program.

This was probably the only thing that really interested me in this
PoC; otherwise they just ripped off my earlier "tabula" plugin work (I
jest).

This could be done with an "annotating debugger" that ran your
function with a set of configured inputs, and annotated every variable
there with its value on the ui. When editing the code, you could at
least run the function to the point where the "done" code ends.

The go concepts of thick/thin and light/heavy apply here.  Light Table
is light but a bit thin, while Leo is thick but a bit heavy.

Leo is thick: it has a permanent DOM and structure.
Leo is heavy: it's a bit clumsy to create new views.
LT is thin: there is no permanent structure.
LT is light: everything is dynamic.

Here is a thought experiment that might be useful.  Suppose we could
just think what we wanted and it would happen.  This would be the
ultimate in "lightness".  Everything would happen instantly, or nearly
so.   No need for key bindings.

The Light Table environment simulates this situation.  With multiple
functions in view, switching between them is simply a matter of moving
our eyes.

However, the Light Table demo "cheated" a bit.  It's feasible to put
lots on the screen when the individual functions are small.  It
wouldn't work with bigger functions.  Furthermore, the demo used the
mouse to select items quickly.  It looks impressive, but it's not the
way programmers work who want to preserve their health.

Despite these caveats, the LT demo and the thought experiment
challenge us to make Leo substantially more light/agile.

From: "Ville M. Vainio" <vivainio@gmail.com>

(idle late night thoughs)

Attached is a screenshot of ipython notebook, if you haven't tried it yet.

How I see it, this could be one possible arrangement for our "leo as a
grid" UI concept, enabled by exploration of the free-layout work.

The notebook is a linear (1 dimensional) scrolling pane; I wonder
whether free-layout's splitter approach works with this one? Splitters
are more typically used in non-scrollable containers, but if it can be
made to work like this, great :).

We can use this kind of linear arrangement even for deeper trees - if
a node is a child of parent, indent it a but more than a parent.
Practical benefit of this is that we could put "computation" at depth
1, and the result of the computation as child of that, at depth 2.
Navigability is lost if we add much more depth, but 2 levels should be
just fine.

PS. Incidentally, the ipython notebook work that started some years
ago was a spark for me to look at leo-ipython bridge, and actually
become a member of leo community ;-). I saw that leo offered a much
easier way to do a notebook/workbook like concept.

I don't get it. What's supposed to happen? Maybe some screenshots or a

...later: Ok, I get a little bit more by inserting "run Plugins >>

Incidentally look at this recent IPEP (Ipython Enhancement Proposal)
which allows for leo like cell-level directives (which in Ipython are
called magic commands): https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/1611

Leo + Ipython notebook integration is a killer app indeed.

Yes, that's what it does, not really useful, just a proof of concept /
demo of how easy it is to add new gui components using the free_layout
framework.  Instead of text editors for each child node you could have
custom IPython result display widgets, or whatever.

We could do a custom layout that stacks widgets on top of each other, and
have that in a scroll area. If all else fails, it can be done with QML.

Unless there is a Qt bug, the free_layout splitters can be embedded in
any parent frame, including scrolling panes.  Indeed, the free_layout
gui elements are subclasses of QSplitter and QSplitterHandle.

I'm usually skeptical of using a fixed number of levels, but your

mathematicians count?  Answer: one, two, many and too many.  Usually
we want "many", but maybe in this case "two" will do ;-)

I'm not sure I knew that.  It would be great to add something to the

Certainly you can have scrolling widgets in free_layout panes.  I
haven't tried IPython notebook, so I was wondering if Ville meant could
free_layout panes be used to hold each output block from ipython.
Probably not, but not I think about it a tabula like grid wouldn't help
either.  Ipython notebook in would need a widget with a QVBoxLayout to
which it added result blocks.

Would it make sense for the actual result blocks to be stored in Leo
nodes, and for the long scrolly view thing to be essentially a view of
them concatenated, appearing in their own free-rendered pane, such that
clicking one just selects the corresponding node in Leo, for editing in
the body pane etc.?

This can be deployed on web or locally. Interesting use cases are
browsing Leo notes you composed elsewhere on your tablet, and

I will notify the mailing list on the progress; it may be slow since I

Does leo need tags for nodes?

Interface wise I see something similar to the the bookmarks.py
interface, shown in the attached, colored strings indicating the tags a
node has, probably a bit smaller.  Various commands and clicks for
adding or removing tags and navigating through the nodes with a
particular tag, or set of tags.

This would be useful for all sorts of things, but Leo, being Leo,
already has features that overlap functionality wise.  You could
collect clones of all the nodes you want to identify with a particular
tag, under a single parent node, which becomes the tag proxy thing.

You can do something similar with the backlinks.py plugin which provides
unrestricted node linking, just link all the nodes which need a
particular tag to a particular node.

But I'm guessing only a tag centric UI component will give the quick
and easy use you'd want from a tagging system.  Data wise I guess tags
could be a simple list of string, p.v.u['_tags'], with Leo maintaining
an index of tag to node list mappings.

Any thoughts / other software's approaches to look at?

I sort of implemented tags in my rpg.leo project - basically a series of

It worked, it was simple, and to be honest, I don't think that Leo 
really needs them.  I'm sure there is some functionality that I'm 
missing out on, though.  Perhaps for those who don't wish to maintain 
lists of clones, or for sorting into groups based on common tags.  
Perhaps even a view-rendered extension that would render a clickable tag 
cloud of an entire outline?

A very quick first response.

- Support for tags as uA's would be natural.
- User interface issues more complicated, of course.
- In general, Leo has not paid enough attention to searches/tags as
alternatives to clones.
- Finding by tag, cloning by tag, etc. all seem natural.
- Kent's and Terry's suggestions are always worth consideration :-)

My view of Leo as a data manager means I want tags.
I've been thinking I'd address them in the context of the

Display location, maybe a tab in the output pane.
Maybe enter them via minibuffer?
<alt-x> tags= ideas, terry, tagging

Maybe they could display in the minibuffer until <alt-x> was pressed.
IE; tags for current node on display until minibuffer is needed.

wish list:
- tab completion / drop-down list to prevent creating similar tags
- import / export of tags, encourage consistent ontologies
- hooks which parse the node content, create tags from them

From: Kent Tenney <ktenney@gmail.com>

The editor envy resulting from the Light Table demo has me revisiting
a feature that's been percolating.

Sending output to the log pane is very useful, it's how Leo talks back.

Executing from the command line means one space for input and output.

Executing in a Leo node and writing to the log improves on this by providing
different spaces for input and output.

Could Leo generalize this concept such that any node could be designated as
a destination for output?

Given multiple visible nodes, akin to Terry's stickynotes, or Ville's
recent grid
suggestion, Leo could duplicate the power of simultaneous feedback shown
by Light Table.

I guess 'rendering' addresses this to some degree.

Reminds me of the power graph database folks talk about, where you can
define nodes and edges to be whatever you want.

The nodes could be sources or sinks.
Sources: code or commands ...
Sinks: standard out, tail -f logfile, network traffic, introspection ...

The edges would define handlers for the content of the sources, format the
results and send to the sinks.

So, as I write code in one node, I can see a node displaying stdout, another
watching a log file, another showing docstrings, another showing test
results ...

Interesting connection.  We might want to render to tabula nodes.

This is coming.  Redefining edges would be easy provided that they had

To paraphrase: nodes and links are not simply ways to represent

The 'ileo workbook' concept is relevant; it allowed you to easily reference
other nodes in your scripts (wb.foo meant node with headline 'foo').

It's nice in theory, but the rigid ui model where we show only one node at
a time made it hard to visualize. Tabula or grid would make it more
concrete and intuitive - you could show input, output and the manipulator
script at the same time. Or make small nodes with intermedote results etc.

How this would relate to 'pipeline' - you would have explicit way to say
what nodes are input, whan nodes are output and what are the scripts that
transform input to output. Editing inputs or scriyts would ping you somehow
that outputs are out of date, allowing you to easily press button to
recalculate outputs.

In fact, the inadequacy of my remark that assigning to v.b was all
that was needed lead me to consider the broadcaster/listener
framework.

The idea is that the v.b setter property would broadcast the fact that
v.b has changed to all the listeners connected to v.  Presumably,
those listeners will be UI elements that will update their text from
v.b and recolor as appropriate.

We might generalize this concept to update outline structure in those
UI elements that show outlines.

An excellent generalization.  We can use this without knowing exactly
what the feedback is, or where it comes from.

Keeping up with ourselves these days seems like a full-time job.

I believe a broadcaster/listener event framework is an essential
ingredient.  It shouldn't be too hard to do, it will simplify existing
code, and it will be an enabling technology that will stimulate
further development.

Right. Leo can be considered a programming language, it is able

From: "Edward K. Ream" <edreamleo@gmail.com>

As the title indicates, this thread will consist of what could be
called an online engineering notebook.  Please feel free to ignore.

Key bindings are one of the most difficult and complex parts of Leo.
This can't be helped: Leo's goals for key bindings are ambitious.

The present bug, https://bugs.launchpad.net/leo-editor/+bug/879331, is
due to a significant design oversight.  Redefining a binding for a
command x to key y affects not just command x but all other commands
presently bound to y!

Alas, the present binding tables are already complex.  I am almost at
the limit of what I can hold in working memory as it is.  Adding
significant additional complexity risks creating virtually impossible-
to-understand code.

There are two conflicting desires in play here:

1. To make the minimum changes needed.  While reasonable in itself,
this promises to increase overall complexity.

2. To decrease overall complexity.  While reasonable in itself, this
promises significant overall changes to the code.

Combining these two desires yields a strategy of finding a minimal
change that reduces overall complexity :-)  It's a big ask.

     * Even when file directly clicked, doesn't open.
     * Only opens from File menu. Annoying & inconvenient. 
  2. Same file as node opened in notepad then edited while still open in 
Leo doesn't update, even on refresh.
  3. Does not open python files in Idle with selection of menu item: File

I'm on Windows 8. I've already spent several hours solving other problems 
and reading Leo documentation. Any links or tips to overcome these problems 
quickly would be appreciated.

You must set the file association manually, at present.  Getting this to

Hmm.  It seems like setting file associations isn't documented anywhere.

The vim and xemacs plugins do an automatic refresh.  It won't be possible

OpenWith:Idle opens a Leo *node*, not a file.  However, you could use @edit
to put an entire file into a node, and then open the @edit node with Idle.

I personally never use Idle, which is probably why OpenWith:Idle isn't very
useful.  Instead, I use g.pdb.

Thanks for your comments.  Please feel free to continue this conversation.

https://notex.ch/ is interesting.  It uses ExtJS plus CodeMirror for in
browser editing (Ville recently linked to http://ace.ajax.org/, a
similar thing).  The CodeMirror JS editor includes a tree widget
apparently.

Beyond the JS as an interface for web-Leo, the notex project is
interesting because of the way it's distributed.  Seems you're expected
to use it online, or, if you want a local install, to run it in a
virtualbox virtual machine.  Very cloudy :-)

Cool, it looks pretty much like the hypothetical future Web version of Leo :)

.. @+node:ekr.20130806072439.21380: *5* QML - new window / gui / coding for Leo?
From: Terry Brown <terry_n_brown@yahoo.com>

This thread will need Ville to set it on the right track, I barely know
the names of the technologies, but Qt has been advancing with, quoting
from their site:

  Qt Quick
  
  The Qt UI Creation Kit lets you create rich, touch-enabled UIs and
  apps...quickly.
  
      * QML - CSS & JavaScript like language, same code base for UI
        designers & developers
  
      * Supported by Qt Creator IDE for rapid prototyping and development
  
      * Qt Quick UI runtime - Direct access to native APIs, performance
        boost with C++

I think the first bullet is most relevant to Leo.  Could we embed this
kind of environment in Leo?  Can it be integrated effectively with the
current GUI?

That route might make adding task specific GUIs in Leo quick and easy.

Cheers -Terry

Only for knoledge, there is also an interesenting possibility in WT 
(http://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt), a QT-like (often identical api) web 
framework.
WT that is c++ have bindings in ruby and a mantained reimplementation in 
java.
I think that the web-interface is the right direction, but although I like this 
kind of framework,  i think that the route of widget-like framework (like 
wt) is worse than other web-mv* solutions.

Not for the touch part (although Leo on a tablet would be fun), but as
a way of quickly creating task specific GUIs, "forms" if you like, for
accessing / interacting with the data in a Leo outline.  I'm assuming
that QML is higher level / less coding the regular PyQt programming,
but I don't know that, not having tried it.

I assume that this is a kind of support for iphone-like features.
They will be part of Windows 8 as well:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Dp92QfWOw88I

It's not clear how Leo could use this technology.

QML is actually lower level than QWidgets / "regular" PyQt
programming. Key selling point of QML is that the UI's are more free
form, "custom" and much faster than QWidget UI's (in Qt5, QML maps
quite naturally to OpenGL, making it fly on mobile phone/tablet
hardware).

QML would be natural for graphcanvas / tabula / other "custom" ui
plugins, but it doesn't yet have text editor as powerful as QTextEdit,
not tree widget as powerful as QTreeWidget / QTreeView.

I expect QML to be first used in mobile version of Leo (I have one
actually, that I will publish "at later date" ;-). For desktop, QML is
not yet as attractive as the "old stuff".

From: "Ville M. Vainio" <vivainio@gmail.com>

--20cf30549cebc8e86704be9bed43


Ok, I now created a toy UI demo for how "cell" based leo (like ipython
notebook) could operate.

It's probably the first stab at using QML to solve a problem in Leo.
It doesnt' run from leo yet (it's not a plugin, more protoing needed
before it's worthwhile to make it a plugin.

When you add and delete text, the cells resize naturally.

To try it, launch the launchqmlnb.py script that I pushed to bzr.

Interesting ...

Am I correct: this is POC, edits in your serialized pane don't reflect
in the Leo file?

This is a hint of something I've long wanted, what I have called
'slurped' vs 'chunked'
Something I miss with Leo is the capability get an overview of a file,
I find myself
needing to 'open file with gvim' to grok at file level.

The pane you are generating offers both at once, I can see the linear
view of the file,
retaining the 'chunk' metadata (node headlines)

Played with it.  I guess the next step would be demo of python handling
events from the QML UI elements, and of python finding and manipulating
the QML UI elements.

I'm wondering about the advantages of this approach over the "regular"
QWidget approach.  QML is perhaps a more terse and elegant language for
defining a UI, and it has scripting of UI behavior in javascript.  And
perhaps it has a more tablet friendly widget set?

But I wonder what it lets you do that you can't do with the QWidget
stack, given that mixing the two seems to mean that Leo is using two
GUI systems - they may be very tightly integrated, but mind-space wise
it's two complex systems instead of one.

Which isn't a reason not to use QML, just wondering if it has
advantages I'm missing.

Cheers -Terry

Some modifications done, attached is screenshot with tree level
nesting as well. I moved the headistring to the left edge, since on
the right edge the tree structure looked weird.

From: "Ville M. Vainio" <vivainio@gmail.com>

This leo script is more polished version of the earlier work (ctrl+b
script). It uses QStandardItemModel to host the entries in the
notebook, so you can add / remove / modify items and the changes
reflect in the notebook in real time.

Qml version was the one I got done quickly, since it has better layout
mechanism. If we come up with qwidget way, let's use that :). I tried

Played with it.  I guess the next step would be demo of python handling
events from the QML UI elements, and of python finding and manipulating
the QML UI elements.

I'm wondering about the advantages of this approach over the "regular"
QWidget approach.  QML is perhaps a more terse and elegant language for
defining a UI, and it has scripting of UI behavior in javascript.  And
perhaps it has a more tablet friendly widget set?

But I wonder what it lets you do that you can't do with the QWidget
stack, given that mixing the two seems to mean that Leo is using two
GUI systems - they may be very tightly integrated, but mind-space wise
it's two complex systems instead of one.

Which isn't a reason not to use QML, just wondering if it has
advantages I'm missing.

Cheers -Terry

Update: qmlnotebook.leo (ctrl+b script + test outline) is now at
contrib branch. If you want to try it, open the .leo file, ensure you
are running latest Leo from trunk, and press ctrl+b on the first node.

Here's a demo to run Ville's QML thing in a free_layout pane.
Requires rev. 5284 so the .qml file in leo/plugins/qmlnb/ is available.

Paste this into a node, run-script on the node, right click a splitter
handle, Insert, click the Action button, select "Add QML shower".

Note that you can flick the text boxes it shows up and down with the
mouse, in a tablet / phone ui kind of way.

Yes, modifications are not saved yet. Also, modifications in normal body
editors are not copied over to the notebook yet.  This is probably going to
end up like tabula and stickynotes in this regard.

Getting an overview of a file could be an interesting extra usecase, my
main interest is still in using it for interactive programming/computation
(like ipython notebook) .

Ok, this should serve as a basis for ipython nicely.

However, a problem - it worked once, but now (after restarting leo,
many times) I always get this traceback;

.. @+node:ekr.20130806072439.21395: *6* Re: QML notebook - phase zero - toy ui ;-)
From: "Ville M. Vainio" <vivainio@gmail.com>

And on related note: remember that with QML, sky is the limit as far
as the styling goes :). So if you have wild ideas about adding
customizable images, animated checkboxes, or other weird stuff next to
the nodes, fire away.

Work ongoing.

bzr pull, and paste this into a node and press ctrl+b:

https://gist.github.com/2517158

Result is as attached. What it currently does is putting every node
wrapper in a list of QObjects, and use that as the model in QML side
(model is just a container that has the list of stuff to show in
Repeater).

So you can edit every node in a leo document in this "notebook".
Future version will probably only allow editing a subtree.

Note how headlines are "toned down" with small, grey font. Intention
is that e.g. with ipython notebook, the headline will just be a
running, uneditable sequence number basically.

BTW, forgot to mention that I put the NodeWrapper stuff under
leo.core. We can move it out eventually, but right now it seemed like
a natural place for this kind of cross-plugin utility.

.. @+node:ekr.20130806072439.21428: *5* Set of markup2html converter
From: tfer <tfetherston@aol.com>




Having played with Jacob Peck's markdown fork, I now get what leo is doing 
to provide a preview of text using a markup type. It is converting that 
markup, (rst: built-in, markdown: proposed).  What is being done is to run 
the text through a xxx2html converter and then using a Qt window widget 
that renders the generated html.

There have been requests to extend the built in rst functionality to other 
markup types, (Peck has an experimental one for markdown).  Rather than 
added them piecemeal, I think we could incorporate the code github uses to 
allow people to use their preferred markup language for their projects 
readme file.  Although a number of the converters are written in ruby, some 
are python and one is even pearl.  It is an extensible scheme.  The license 
for the library is basically, "keep the copyright notice and have at it", 
so it shouldn't cause any problem.

The code is here:
  https://github.com/github/markup

The current "see the selected node's body text" in the view-render-pane 
should work, the only thing lacking is a way to preview an entire file. 
 How about adding an option to preview it in the context menu for a right 
click on an @file node?

Even being a dev, and a Unix sysadmin, I do most of my work in Windows, 
because of company policies and personal requirements. That's a lot of 
gunk to download for some markup plugin.  Just my $0.02.

Looking at the library, it seems dead simple.  It could easily be

A good point, though if this is just being used as a plug-in, not a huge 
one, especially if one is on linux or mac, (which I'm not).

Hm, I wasn't aware there were so many converters in python.  Maybe the

Would really like asciidoc, that looks like the ideal book writing markup.

Well, the vim plugin, (send node or @file to vim for editing there), should 
provide this.  It uses temp files and so for the @file case generates a 
'full file'.  Of course, given this is python, it should be possible to use 
a file-like object that exists only in memory and use duck typing.

That was actually my first thought when approaching the markdown 
implementation.  The major problem here is that the wrapper program, and 
several of the assorted converters are in ruby.  The only python one is 
rest2html, which we already have (via docutils).  I don't think adding 
ruby and perl as dependencies for one small feature of Leo would be 
wise...  that seems to me to be the very definition of bloatware.

That being said, github-markup supports the following formats, which are 
supported by python libs:

markdown (markdown)
rst (docutils)
textile (textile)
org mode (pyorgmode)
creole (python-creole)
mediawiki (mw2html)
asciidoc (asciidoc)

The following do not have a python equivalent (to my knowledge):

rdoc (ruby documentation)
perlpod (perl documentation)

I could certainly keep hacking on viewrendered to support the first

I could look into this suggestion too, if someone would point me in the 
right direction with respect to 2 things (I'm really new to Leo, so I 
have no idea where these things are in the source):

1. How to add a context menu item for a node
2. How to get a "full file" without saving it, i.e., fill in the << 
references >>, @others, and @all directives.

.. @+node:ekr.20130806072439.21443: *5* threaded saveAll()
From: Terry Brown <terry_n_brown@yahoo.com>

I guess this is a wishlist item - I suspect it is a result of my
workflow that might be quite different from other peoples, but I often
need to save 4, 6, even more open changed Leo files at once.  Mainly
when I'm filing / adjusting todo items, although at the end of a
session having 4 changed files open can't be that unlikely.

So it would be really nice if c.saveAll() could be threaded.  Even as I
write this, it gets more complicated as I think about it :-}

  - each thread should do no user interface calls, or at least no calls
    that aren't deferred to the main thread

    - that's ok, would take quite a bit of tracing to catch them all,
      but doable - except - plugins called from save hooks might break
      the rule

  - updating recent files list would have to be done properly, not a
    big deal

  - multiple threads saving to the same external files would be a
    problem, that's the complication that only just occurred to me

I don't typically have the same external file referenced from multiple
Leo files, why would you do that... so the last problem, although
potentially major, might be theoretical more than practical.

Hmm, well it's a thought.  First thing to check, is saving IO bound or
CPU bound...

Cheers -Terry

Since the flat document is a sort of "rambling" blue sky topic, I added
some more thought on G+ leo community instead of increasing mailing list
noise:

I'm pretty sure saving is cpu bound; for "normal" size documents, flushing
that kind of stuff to disk (or memory buffers that are to be written to
disk) shouldn't take significant amount of time.

I've just found that, because these todo items are always in the
outline itself and not external files, I can just do 
'write outline only' on all the open outlines, and this is much faster
and smooths out the bump in my workflow that got me started thinking
about this.

Probably right, so could you use `multiprocessing` instead of
`threading`?  More challenging implementation wise, but I'm wondering
if it's even possible, in terms of handing over the in-memory data
structure?

Multiprocessing based implementation will likely be quite hard, and once
you walk the trees anyway and copy the data over the process boundary, it
could cause bad pauses in execution.

I have often thought how nice it would be to have "flat" storage for the
leo document, so that you could just copy over a flat chunk of memory and
let other processes traverse that. Doing that is a somewhat nontrivial
undertaking, to say the least :).

I'd just start with threads, despite the GIL problems.

As Ville says, this is a perennial topic.  And for good reason.  This is 
one of those "big questions" that it would be useful to discuss at length 
at the Leo sprint.

Another topic is best workflow practices.  Kent and I are interested in 
looking over Terry's shoulder for awhile :-)

I would also like to discuss data base ideas.

> Leo in the browser - here, it's well worth looking at the excellent 
Checkvist cloud-based outliner at www.checkvist.com. It's got some great

I agree.  It's impressive.

are up to the job, versus how hard it would be to implement Leo in 
<brain-haemorrhage>Javascript</brain-haemorrhage>

CoffeeScript, http://coffeescript.org/, is the proper way to program in 
JavaScript.  It should not cause any brains to explode.  Importantly, there 
are tools that will convert JavaScript to CoffeeScript.  I would want to do 
this conversion before studying existing code.

Having said this, programming directly in CoffeeScript looks like an 
"heroic" approach.  Checkvist proves that such an approach is possible.  
Perhaps someone could convert Checkvist to CoffeeScript automatically, and 
then relatively easily move on to Leo.  But unless somebody in the Leo 
community actually has a *lot* of time on their hands, basing a project on 
CoffeeScript isn't likely to make much headway. 

This leaves us with the question of in-browser frameworks.  I haven't paid 
any attention to this important topic.  I imagine that there has been 
continuous incremental (or revolutionary) progress since last we looked 
around.  I would like to explore the possibilities at the Leo sprint.

These are just my thoughts.  Feel free to suggest new ideas here, or to 
bring up new topics at the sprint.  There won't be any formal agenda.

Edward

SQLAlchemy is too big of a dependency for the trivial queries that are
needed to model leo documents in sql. There are no complex joins or
anything like that.

There is also very little need to revisit the db accessing code once it's
been written.

I use Django's ORM a lot, and it is nice for complex schemas.  I've
used SQLAlchemy in the past too.  We can certainly go that way if
specializing the adapter layer for our 'cloud' storage becomes
burdensome, but I think initially our schema would be simple enough
that it wouldn't be worth the dependency, and we'd need to handle
things like git and non-sql DBs anyway.

Don't know what the adapter layer will look like yet, but I imagine it
will be something like

update = adapter.get_new_nodes(since=from_date)

and 

adapter.push(c.p)

etc.

Cheers -Terry

At has command alt-x git-dump, that dumps the tree as bunch of flat files
(named by gnx) and commits changes to git repository.

Great point, hand waving is fun, but tested code is more useful.

An attainable goal for the sprint could could provide structure
within which to compare workmethods.

I second this recommendation.  Having recently worked on a project using 
SQLAlchemy, I have to say it's fairly simple to add SQLA's ORM to any 
old Python class.  Trivial in most cases, even.

There is a many-to-many related join between nodes and their parents. It
would simply be parent as a foreign key, except that Leo supports cloned
nodes.

Seems to me there's a whole bunch of loosely related issues here:

 1) performance - save time seems to be the biggest issue - it's not
 terrible, but slow to save several large outlines at once.  The time
 is in the generating of the content of the @<file> plain text files,
 so XML / database / cloud is probably not relevant here.  A C/++
 helper might help, although it introduces distribution complexities, a
 pure python option should be maintained as well.

 2) Leo data on a server accessible anywhere.  In terms of who has
 access to what kinds of servers, the simplest and most widely
 available way to get this is probably simply keeping Leo files in
 DropBox or some similar service.

 2a) Leo in any web-browser.  Either as pure coffee/javascript, or a
 front end to python running on a server somewhere.  The former would
 be easier if only outlines and not derived @<file>s were edited, the
 latter means you need hosting on a server somewhere.  Both require a
 lot of dev. time.

 3) Leo using a DB as a storage mechanism.  This really has to be for
 some reason, presumably to enable other items in this list.  Not sure
 if there's a performance boost here without lazy loading, which is a
 big implementation issue, particularly for searches etc.  Also, unless
 you read the whole outline from the DB at once, I'm not sure about
 performance on hierarchical data like Leo's.  Postgresql supports
 `WITH RECURSIVE` which could fetch subtrees in one request, not sure
 about other DBs.  Maybe not a problem with non-sql DBs.

 4) Simultaneous / collaborative outline editing by multiple users.
 This is where implementation gets hard unless there are APIs (Google?)
 out there we can use off the shelf.  Real-time simultaneous is
 particularly challenging, but even reconciling edits by others
 intermittently is tricky when you have issues like subtrees being
 moved around the outline etc.

 5) Versioned Leo nodes.  This can be done independently of (4), it
 would be quite easy to support node-local node histories in either
 sqlite or git.  Git offers the possibility of being an alternative to
 a DB backend for (4), seeing it's probably not that hard to get free
 hosting for git repos, easier than DB hosting maybe.  A bit more
 thought needed on the DB schema, I guess both nodes (headline, body,
 *and* unknownAttributes) and links would need to be versioned.
 Version identity would need to be some combination of time and user id
 (a gnx? :-)

I think it would be interesting to experiment with some mixture of
3/4/5, in a code something and see what happens way.  Keep it simple by
starting with user initiated import/export events instead of trying to
completely replace the load/save process, and perhaps ignore @<file>s
at first - in a way they're intrinsically tied to local resources.

Perhaps a first step is to define a DB/DVCS adapter layer, which can
fetch and store nodes and links to/from some backend.
What should it return to Leo?  A simple nested Python data structure I
guess, perhaps with the option to build it into a subtree at a
specified location.  Can we use gnx's everywhere as node / link IDs for
these transactions?

From: Kent Tenney <ktenney@gmail.com>

What do people imagine a 'Leo in the cloud' session would look like?

I open a file which changes as I edit it, but also changes as others edit it?
That sounds unsettling and not useful.

I can see a Leo file as the moral equivalent of a git working tree.
I push my Leo file to a repository, others can clone it and make edits.

I can fetch their edits, merge them or not. They do the same.

The result is a file with history, tags and branches. A template file
would include menus, buttons and commands to manage the git backend.

Thanks,
Kent

The many-to-many relationship is easily handled by "edges" table here:

https://gist.github.com/vivainio/1493084

The "edges" approach would work for arbitrary graphs as well, but it can
fully represent the Leo DAG.

The only sensible (i.e. performant) way to use it in production code would
be to slurp in the whole "edges" table and create in-memory representation
out of it. Any lazy loading should happen with text bodies.

  If you're going to use a DB, take a look at SQLAlchemy, particularly 
the ORM layer.  You could achieve a level of independence from a 
particular DBMS, and might find it useful to have an object model.

Thanks. This statement got me reading about CofeeScript. Javascript has
been surfacing with increasing frequency at work but I've been largely
ignoring it as my wee brain is already full with learning python. CS makes
it look approachable and not so distant a possibility.

Today I've run into Iced, *"a superset of
CoffeeScript<http://coffeescript.org>.
... a drop-in replacement for the standard coffee interpreter; it will
interpret almost all existing CoffeeScript programs. ...[it] adds two new
keywords: await and defer. These additions simply and powerfully streamline
asynchronous control flow, both on the server and on the browser. ... Say
hello to clean, readable, maintainable control flow for network and
asynchronous operations!"*

   -- http://maxtaco.github.io/coffee-script/

The example for how these 2 simplekeywords can dramatically affect code
readability under the heading "ICS and Standard Control
Flow<http://maxtaco.github.io/coffee-script/#iced_control>"
is compelling.

ICS:
```

# Search for 'keywords' in parallel, then callback# 'cb' with an array
of the parallel results
parallelSearch = (keywords, cb) ->
  out = []
  await
    for k,i in keywords
      search k, defer out[i]
  cb out

```
CoffeScript:
```

# Search for 'keywords' in parallel, then callback# 'cb' with an array
of the parallel results
parallelSearch = (keywords, cb) ->

Some thoughts sparked by the conversation thus far which may or may not be
pertinent:

File vs DB storage: I remember reading that with PhpWiki(?), which can use
files or mysql or pgsql for storage, that there were zero performance gains
realized with DB over files until the number of pages dealt with were in
the tens of thousands.

Live concurrent editing would be tr=E9s cool, but asynchronous diff and mer=
ge
of nodes similar to DVCS would be just fine in my opinion. (This project
might be interesting, once they stop being coy and just show it:
https://editorially.com/)

From: "Ville M. Vainio" <vivainio@gmail.com>

Hey,

No time to mock this up right now, just throwing it out there.

"tabula" plugin allowed you to edit many nodes simultaneously in an
MDI canvas - i.e. you could move the body editors around freely.

How about taking this idea further and locking the body editors in a
grid, or column?

One fun idea would by layout like this

            | Child 1
Outline  | Child 2
            | Child3

That is, you would edit and view all the children of the currently
focused node all at once. We can already do two body editors at once,
so this would seem like natural extension.

Of course you could only see a small amount of text per body, but for
a "workbook" / sheet like use cases it would be fine.

Yes.  This might the key.

As I was thinking about doing body editors with free_layout (and by
extension, the tabula editors) I had another new thought: it's time to
replace the present difficult selection code with a broadcaster/
listener framework.

In particular, the multiple body editor code is on the verge of
collapse because it tries to figure out too much in a spaghetti-like
mass of logic.  This doesn't generalize, and Leo is becoming so
"exuberant" in its IDE that a simpler, more general mechanism is
becoming essential.

Tabula is part of the stickynotes plugin.  It creates the following commands:

         tabula
         tabula-marked
         tabula-show
         tabula-subtree

The "windowlets" show the node's headline. So this is the "sea of nodes" view!

The tabula nodes are "live": changes made in the tabula window
instantly affect the corresponding nodes in the regular outline.

An easter egg: double-clicking the title of a windowlet fills the
tabula window with the windowlet.  Another double-click undoes the
expansion.

> How about taking this idea further and locking the body editors in a

Good idea.  The tabula window is a great playground for invention.

In the "multi-colored link" world (coming soon, I hope), we could
imagine commands that create "tabula-colored" links, so that the
tabula window would work like a chapter.  (And each chapter would have
its own links).

The Light Table video suggested something else that I never considered
before.  Suppose each node "carries" its own mini-context outline,
showing just the parents of the node.  The tabula window might be
natural for that.

The idea is that each windowlet would have two parts:  the top would
show the parents, the bottom would show the body pane.  This allows
context to be visible without actually having to show the outline
pane.

Are you suggesting doing free-layout in tabula?

If you fill the cells with stickynotes (as in tabula), the editors would at
least stick to the nodes.

Otoh, if more felxible body editors are just around the corner, it may not
be worth the hassle.

'publish / subscribe' has buzzword cred these days, there are several
protocols out there, reportedly fairly simple to implement, don't know
if any are a fit here.

Attached screen-shot shows the potential for free-layout with the new
Open Window command to open a separate window as a 'grid' editor.  Here
instead of body editors I just have 5 view-rendered panes open, and
they're all looking at the same node because there's no mechanism for
locking them to separate nodes presently(*).  Free layout could handle
body editors in the same way, if they were more agnostic about their
containers.

You are probably right. We Could also adjust the sizes dynamically
based on the amount of text in the nodes

Ok, but I still think it makes sense to implement this with the
free-layout system, so that your grid could be a separate window, or
not, as desired.  free-layout is basically nested QSplitters, so it can
represent a grid, but with more flexibility (cell 1,0 doesn't have to
be the same height as cell 0,0, etc.)

I often use "Edit in notepad" (or more likely pyscripter) for this
purpose. It would be nice to stay inside Leo; I sometimes lose data by
forgetting which editor has the most current version.

Plus, free-layout provides persistence: it's worth putting effort into
configuring pane configuration because it will be available next time.

(I guess I'm persistent about wanting persistence)

Thanks,

Although such a framework might be quite useful, I can't help thinking
it would insert a big delay between now and getting flexible body
editors implemented.

I think that getting body editors working as described in my recently
bumped "Free range body editors" post would not be that hard, certainly
simpler and faster than a broadcaster / listener framework.  And the
current multiple body editors code could just be dropped completely, so
while I suspect you're right about it being on the edge of implosion, I
don't think that's a problem :-)

I am bringing another angle into play here - systematic selection of what
nodes are shown in the editors, in the proposed scheme we would have a
single column of editors, each displaying every child of currently selected
node.

Expanding the scope to a grid, we could have a grid-lock-column that would
freeze the current column, allowing you to move the selected position in
the tree to another node, and locking the nodes for column 2 etc etc

Woohoo - done and pushed.  Went for the second option, instead of
pop-out windows holding a single widget, they hold a whole new
free-layout hierarchy, which of course can be a single widget, or much
more, if you want.  See the 'Open Window' command on the free-layout
splitter handle context menu.

Even made a screencast to demonstrate, but unfortunately the sound was
useless, despite being ok in trials before hand.  Might try again later.

When the body editor is a well behaved widget it should be straight
forward to place them where ever you want in using the free-layout
mechanism.  I think that's a better goal, it allows you more
flexibility in terms of maybe one small (both dimensions) and one large
editor, for example.

The new broadcaster/listener framework should probably be designed to
handle this.  That is, in the new framework it should explicitly be
possible to select multiple nodes.

No, although that gives me another idea...

Another feature I've wanted to add to free_layout is popping out any
element into its own window (replacing sticky-notes).  You could go one
better and pop-out free-layout frames which could contain multiple
widgets, like tabula currently does.

I'll try and get those features into free-layout.  Note that a couple
of widgets already have their own pop-out capability, the body editor
and view-rendered.

Also some frame manipulation tools in free-layout would be good.  To
maximize / restore one frame, and layout frames in a grid, if there was
an intent to replace tabula.

Not that tabular needs replacing, but I think it's benefits can be
generalized.

From: HansBKK <hansbkk@gmail.com>




This is highly off-topic for most on the list, so feel free to ignore, but 
anyone using Leo for single-source documentation generation/conversion, 
including future googlers, please reply with comments or notes on your 
experiences.

I have been advocating the idea of pushing Leo-derived content to DokuWiki 
as a platform for "wiki-publishing" to enable collaborative/community 
editing of content (1 <../d/msg/leo-editor/fSzVi1Rh5Tg/uu85satgb9YJ>, 2<../d/msg/leo-editor/xf6_HBxlV_c/4RgGYdDh8ywJ>). 
I've also talked about the markup syntax/doc generation tool Txt2tags (1<https://groups.google.com/d/msg/leo-editor/nNEnxoohFBM/XkMPQhqhDRsJ>, 
2 <https://groups.google.com/d/msg/leo-editor/HBhBnAyVG3E/UXHC1jq50iYJ> ).

However, I have recently learned of the wiki platform Gitit<https://github.com/jgm/gitit#readme>, 
which apparently, like DW, also uses plain-text files rather than a 
database back-end, and integrates not only with git but mercurial (and 
darcs).

Gitit also incorporates the Pandoc <http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/>project for its markup syntax, therefore enabling not only markdown but 
reST as a master source input format, while DokuWiki has its own (yet 
another unique) markup syntax 8-( 

With the increasing likelihood that I'll be using Leo as the centerpiece of 
my toolchain, plus the fact that Pandoc is much more actively maintained, 
it's starting to look worth my while to consider switching my "master 
source" content syntax over from Txt2tags to reST. The only downsides are 
that Gitit is a Haskell project rather than Python, and one thing I like 
about Txt2tags is its support for conversion to AsciiDoc, rather than 
Pandoc's direct output to full-blown DocBook XML - but apparently even 
that's in the works in Pandoc's dev version.

Anyone in the Leo community using Gitit, especially for use beyond simple 
code documentation?

I'm using Leo in that scenario (for writing my Thesis and I hope my=20

Now that I'm using Leo + Fossil for my documentation related matters=20

You're right and I like the idea of "everything is a something" when=20
that something is powerful unifying idea. That's the case with Unix's=20
"everything is a file" or Smalltalk's "everything is an object" (in=20
Unix you have also every tool makes one thing and makes it right,=20
combined with pipes). For me these two paradigm's were the ones that,=20
in 70's, were fighting for the mind share  about computer experience of=20
today and both of them won in a dystopic way, but for me "taking genius=20
to understand Unix simplicity"[0], was even more dystopic. When you're=20
trying to empower users the impedance between development and=20
deployment shows the dystopia, at least compared with the original=20
visions, so most of the "end users" cant change the tool that changes=20
them, so, someone else is making decisions about that changes and that=20
users.

[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Quotes

I like the simplicity of light markups and I try myself of not using=20
explicitly nothing as xml and I like also the idea of the light markup=20
being used by VCS tools. That's not where dystopia lies. The problem is=20
not about files or structure but about "meta-structure" (structure=20
talking about structure, as in meta-languages), specially=20
self-referential meta-structure, because self-referential=20
meta-structures are the key for self-directed change, as opposed with=20
change directed by others. When you see how the "world of everything is=20
a file" talks about itself, there is a lot of impedance and=20
discontinuity between source code, binary, apps and docs and there is a=20
long path for the user who is confined to using apps to create docs,=20
but never change the apps that could let she/he to change his/her=20
writing and that's why I want to use Leo this semester with=20
non-technical writers to explore the way that writing change the tool=20
that writes and not only the human who does.

For me a unified emergent meta-structure in the world of "everything is=20
a file" is where lies the power of Leo. You can use an outline to=20
change the way that Leo behaves and that's why having the Leo's=20
self-referential meta-structure is more powerful that the "dystopic=20
world of everything is a file" (in that world you don't have=20
meta-structure, only structure, mostly for storage purposes and the=20
intelligence to read/process it is mostly outside the file, in the=20
human reader, the compiler or the binary). What Leo does is to create=20
self-referentiality in the world of everything is a file by introducing=20
outlines that can talk/structure the files and that can talk about=20
outlines, i.e outlines that can talk about files and about themselves=20
and can reprogram the way Leo itself works, and so Leo is bridging the=20
gap between objects and files in a valuable and unique way.  But we=20
need still to improve, specifically we need a more elegant way to talk=20
about that files, specially about their changes in time, because is in=20

I'm agree with you. Server and gigantism have not to be equal, but=20
unfortunately in the "dystopic informatic world" (where the previous=20
dystopia is just a part) they're most of the time. Portability is the=20

Xiki.org gives a demo of a "wiki" shell for command execution. Leo should

Thanks for the tip -- it will take me a while to get my head around vspace
(will keep an eye on Ville's blog post).

I'm just beginning to appreciate (or imagine) what Ipython, sublime text
editor, leo, xiki, etc could mean for some kind of intelligent document
workbench. Of course the big hurdle is not so much the string processing
(sublime is a good example of how that can be done), but rather the syntax
processing -- i.e. the docbench  (to coin a phrase) should understand the
syntax of whatever is being input and then offer syntax-aware functions....
Sorry, getting a little obscure: all I mean by syntax-aware is the ability
to propose text completions (Leo's autocompletion is a good example --
everything should work like autocomplete!) and allow for intelligent text
changes depending on a database of information (for example, a search and
replace that would  know how to search on "caterpillar" and turn it into
"butterfly" but would not touch "caterpillar truck").

Seems like Leo is not far from doing that synthesis, but it would require
more database integration. So for example, even the python help system does
not have autocomplete. (No criticism there! The great thing about Leo is
that if you want something, you just have to dive in and build it. My day
job might just let me do that!)

Thanks!

Just to clarify, vs-eval, vs-last, vs-last-pretty are quite straight
forward, as I described them below, and do not require comprehension of
the esoterica of value-space :-) I just put them in that plugin (a) to
avoid creating yet another plugin, and (b) because it seemed sensible
to have them use the value-space namespace c.vs, but all that means for
vs-eval, vs-last, vs-last-pretty is that

  a =3D 7

executed by vs-eval assigns a value to a which can be used by
subsequent vs-eval calls (persistent for the lifetime of the session).

For example, make a body with this text

a =3D 7
b =3D 3
a + b

and place the cursor in front of the first 'a'

execute (Alt-x or key binding) vs-eval 4 times

 - first time executes the empty selection and selects the next line
 - second time assigns 7 to a and report 7 in the log
 - third time assigns 3 to b and report 3 in the log
 - forth time calculates a + b and report 10 in the log

executing vs-last(-pretty) would insert the last result (None, 7, 3,
10) in the body.

Cheers -Terry

Got it! The value of valuespace (!) is that that you can make a pythonesque
session persist. I did not realize that there was no direct two-way bridge
to the python window that leo launches. Even if there were, we would want
to make the session persist by logging it into the outline, as
valuespace (vs-create-tree) does.

Thanks for getting me up and running.

Best, Bill

In addition to the outline as a active data document functions of
Ville's value-space plugin, I recently added some simple ;-) commands:

Alt+A vs-eval
Alt+S vs-last
Alt+D vs-last-pretty
(my key bindings)

vs-eval evaluates the selected python in the c.vs namespace.  It makes
an effort to workout what the output should be, and puts it in the
log.  It captures print output to the log too.  It selects the next
line, ready for execution.

vs-last inserts the last result into the body, and vs-last-pretty
does the same, but using pprint formatting.

Ctrl-B also runs the script in the body, but not in a persistent
namespace, running only the selected text doesn't seem to be working,
and it doesn't work so hard to work out the output.

I guess leoscreen would do the same things as the vs-* commands if you
used it against a python shell.  The inspiration for the vs-* commands
was wanting Leo to tell you what 3.57 * 365 / 12 was without a lot of
effort, but of course you can define functions etc. etc.

The leoInspect chapter has a good to-do list:
    
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/leoInspect.html#still-to-do

The assignments_to, assignments_using and the new calls_to getters all
specify a pattern to be matched against the the lhs of assignments (or
against function names in the calls_to getter). At present, the pattern
must match as a plain word match, but it would be more natural to use regex
matches. That’s coming.

Three new getters would give leoInspect the ability to replace refactored code:

    o.token_range: Returns pointers the list of tokens comprising o.
    o.text: Returns o’s source text (a string).
    o.text_range: Returns the starting and ending offsets of the text in the file.

These getters are non-trivial to do, but a reasonable design is in place.

There are two parts to the problem.  Happily, neither requires a
separate tree-traversal class.

A token-info prepass
====================

For each node N of a module's tree, we want to inject the following
two new ivars:

- N.end_lineno: the line number of the last character of the token.
- N.end_col_offset: the (byte) offset of the last character of the
token.

After experimenting with a few traversals last night I suddenly
realized tree structure is irrelevant when computing these fields: we
simply want a **sorted** list of (N.lineno,No.col_offset, N) tuples!

The prepass will use ast.walk(root), to generate the list.  After
sorting the list, the prepass will inject inject N.end_lineno and
N.end_col_offset ivars into each node N by stepping through the list.
The ending values of the previous node on the list are the the same as
the beginning values of the next node on the list.

This prepass need only be done once per module.

token_range
===========

To compute token_range for a *particular* N, we want to discover
values M.end_lineno and M.end_col_offset for M, the **last** token in
N's entire tree.

token_range will do the prepass on the modules tree if necessary.
token_range will then call ast.walk(N) to discover all of N's nodes,
sort the list, and return the last element of the list!

In short, token_range is clean and bullet-proof--a happy result.

2012/05/20: ideas for LeoInspect

- Want hints/cheats that make computations simpler.
    
- A few hours spent on hints/cheats will pay off because such hints are
  descriptive and useful. They are like unit tests in that regards.
    
- Focus on difficult modules: qtGui.py and leoKeys.py.
    
- The assertions for TypedDict and TypedDictOfLists are ugly. We would like
  a lint-like tool to do away with them.

@nocolor-node

Recently, perhaps it was today, there was a remark made about Leo's
Find panel being confusing for newbies.  I have some sympathy for the
remarks.

1.  Looking at Leo's Edit:Find menu, there is no obvious way of doing
a search/replace operation.  I'll fix this soon after 4.9 final.

2.  The Find tab should make it clearer that it is a summary/status
tab only--not a way of actually initiating or continuing searches.
Perhaps using QLabel widgets instead of (disabled) QTextEdit widgets
for the find/change patterns would help a bit.

Command docs
------------

This will create large docs for individual commands from docstrings.

Base this on print-cmd-docstrings.

Plugins docs


Leo must have a create-plugins-doc script that does the same for
plugins.  A prototype of this script exists somewhere.  Making it an
@command node will make it much more visible.

.. @+node:ekr.20111026075003.16481: *4* Support ~/.leo_config.py
@language python
@language rest

1. Imo, it is time to consider adding a typical "startup" file to Leo,
~/leo_config.py, similar to ~/.emacs or ipython_config.py.  This will
make Leo "thicker", that is more professional/standard.

IPython adds lots of bells and whistles to configuration.  Leo
emulates most of them, but .leo_config.py would be a good addition.
Think of .leo_config.py as a lightweight plugin.

leo_config.py should execute after settings have been parsed, but
before plugins have been loaded.  If desired, leo_config.py may
register "start2" event handlers, which execute after all plugins have
been loaded, just before starting the main Qt event loop.

2. Leo commands form a good framework for other solutions to Qt
stylesheet issues.  Consider the following commands::

- qt-stylesheet-set-global-stylesheet
- qt-stylesheet-append-to-global-stylesheet
- qt-stylesheet-set-widget-stylesheet
- qt-stylesheet-append-to-widget-stylesheet

The "--> mode-help" command has the following issues related to the
display of the "Help" tab:

1. Key label always capitalized.

Vim commands are mapped to both lower-case and upper-case keys but always appear
mapped to upper-case keys within the "Help" tab.

2. Layout of tab's contents.

To improve readability and better support narrow tab cards, display the mode's
label without the "enter-" and "-mode" text and place the key label before the
mode label.

For example, the following entries would change from::
    enter-vi-delete-line-mode d
    enter-vi-delete-to-begin-of-word-mode b
to::
    d : vi-delete-line

.. @+node:ekr.20100113075303.6271: *6* Need mode-oriented bindings
Mapping a number to a command or an @mode node works but can not be used as it
prevents the number from being entered as text while in Vi's insert state.

Binding 'bksp' key to back-char to move back a character in command mode
prevents 'bksp' from deleting characters in text edit mode.
.. @+node:ekr.20080616110054.2: *6* Support vim dot command
The ability to repeat the last editing related command by pressing the period
key is not supported and there is no workaround in place.

Binding keys within nodes:

Some commands can be "easily" repeated by having the command's mode
bind itself to the period key.  This is not currently working.  

Support commands requesting input:

Add companion commands that reuse input.  For example, a zap-to-
character-again command could exist which will reuse the key entered
in the last zap-to-character command.  With this support, the mode
that performs the initial command would assign the period key to a
companion mode that is identical to the initial mode but with the zap-
to-character command replaced by the zap-to-character-again command.

Commands requiring companion commands are:
  zap-to-character
  find-character
  backward-find-character
  (Any others?)

Notes:

- The copy of the character should be saved somewhere that does NOT affect the
  contents of the clipboard.

- The same or a separate storage location can be used for all commands to retain
  a copy of the character entered by the user. It doesn't matter since only the
  last command is assigned to the period key to be re-executed.
.. @+node:ekr.20100112051224.6238: *6* Some commands do not work in headline
Leo functions exist which unconditionally set focus to the body pane
regardless of the active pane.

For example, bracket matching commands ("%" key) do not work within
a node's headline text.  Instead, the command is performed on the
node's body text.

Using the "undo" command (key 'u') to undo a change to a node's headline text
only works correctly after another node has been selected. It appears that
changes made to a node's headline text are not recorded in Leo's change history
until the edited node has lost focus.
.. @+node:ekr.20100112051224.6222: *6* Commands requesting user input
Commands requesting user input must be the last command executed within an @mode
node. This prevents the implementation of commands such as "yank to <character>"
that requires a "copy to clipboard" operation after the "find-character"
command.

Maybe we just need more commands...
.. @+node:ekr.20100112051224.6223: *6* Editing node headlines using @mode nodes
Commands modifying or selecting headline text do not work correctly within a
@mode node.

This eliminates accurate implementation of vi's delete/change/substitute/yank
object commands. As a workaround, the commands are currently written to only
select the text. The user must perform the subsequent delete, change,
substitute, and yank.

.. @+node:ekr.20110202094848.12568: *7* Named marks
Another is named marks, in Vim you can store a number of cursor
locations, and recall them to jump around in your code.  This was also
useful in filling out templates as each stop could be given a name
mark.  This helped make filling out a template easier as you weren't
stuck in a linear filling in the blanks in a set order, template stops
where linked in rings, you could jump from the last stop back to the
first and make and changes you wanted on a second go round.  Gravity
of marks made things easier to inspect to determine what stops where
used and which ones were being bypassed.

As these things had an actual presence in the text buffer, it going to
be a little harder to come up with a reasonable work around.

.. @+node:ekr.20100112051224.6236: *7* Two kinds of words
Vi supports two types of words in its commands:

1. Words that consist of only a subset of the character set and
2. words that consist of all characters except the space and tab characters.

Leo's always considers a word to consist of a subset of characters
although some word related commands include different characters
than others.
.. @+node:ekr.20090629183608.8446: *7* Copy/paste/yank/delete
Yank vs. Yank:
Vi's "yank" commands copy the selected text TO the clipboard.
Leo's "yank" commands insert text FROM the clipboard.

copy-text in modes:
Leo's copy-text command does not work within a mode.  As a result,
all "copy to clipboard" capability is being implemented using the
kill-<object> command followed by Leo's "yank" command to put the
text back.

paste-text in modes:
The paste-text command does not work within an @mode node.  Leo's
"yank" command is used instead.

delete-node does not copy node to clipboard:
A copy-node command is issued to copy the node to the clipboard
followed by the delete-node command.

From Tom L

This is hardwired for the first parameter.  Things I need to expand
this:

1. put in a variable that cycles through the tabStops

2. In this mock up, you are entering the parameters in the minibuffer,
a more advanced version would collect each keypress and put it in the
body at the current tabStop, a tab would finalize the entry and
advance to the next stop, no text other than the 'help', ends up in
the minibuffer.

Sinc I'm only modifying existing code without real understanding of
what Leo is doing, any guidance would be appreciated.

Zope3, with it's component based architecture,

Interfaces, Adapters and ZCML, the configuration
language.

It sounds like the autocompleter code is able
to build indexes of classes and methods. It would
be cool if that capability could be extensible,
allowing building indexes of the couplings between
components.

I think this might look like some kind of automatic
hyperlinking, providing access to related code,
as defined for that application.

I really don't know if this makes sense, but
I see you moving in the direction of making Leo
capable of doing some _explaining_ of the code

.. @+node:ekr.20111216105907.10218: *6* My response: this is a wishlist item
@nocolor-node

Reposted from http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/67a28984616d09c9
About bug 882243: clones sometimes not saved

I'd like to discuss this bug here, because I would like us all to be aware of the situation, and possible changes.

The surprise
=========

To paraphrase the original bug report, suppose we have the following @file tree:

+ @file test.txt
@others
  + node 1 (cloned)
    node 1 text.
  + node 2
     @others
    + node 1 (cloned)
       node 1 text.

As usual, lines preceded by "+" denote headlines: all other lines are body text.

The surprise is that the cloned node1 node is written to the external file only once (as a child of the root node) and hence does not appear as a (cloned) child of the node2 node when Leo next loads the @file tree.

History
=====

I would like to call this a wishlist item because the
present code quite intentionally writes *any* node
(including cloned nodes) only once. That is, the write code
sets a bit when writing a node, and @others ignores any
nodes with that bit set.

You could call this a bug in the @others write logic, but at
one time it was done explicitly and on purpose.

I don't remember why this was so, but I do remember it *was*
so. It may have been an artifact of Leo's old representation
of clones that used both vnodes and tnodes. tnodes no longer
exist in the one-node world that we have been living in for
several years, and it may well be time to revisit the
original design, but I would rather not do that just now
because there are several "real" bugs that need attention
asap.

Workaround
=========

Because this is an issue involving @others, you might assume
that a workaround involving sections would be possible. You
would be correct. The following file works as expected::

+ @file test.txt
<< node 1 >>
<< node 2 >>
  + << node 1>> (cloned)
     node 1 text.
  + << node 2 >>
     << node 1 >>
    + << node 1 >>(cloned)
       node 1 text.

One feature I have not seen in SCS system is something which might be called
"history compression": I might be interested in having both version 5 and 6
in my source tree, when the current version is 7, but I am not really interested
in the 2000 steps which transformed 5 into 6 (just suggested this feature to
the bazaar people). This happens actually quite often to me, since I use the
SCS as a back-up system, saving many (uninteresting) intermediate steps while
implementing a new feature.

.. @+node:ekr.20100209160132.5770: *5* cache notes
Top-level folder are direct subfolders of .leo/db.
Top-level folders represent file *locations* not file contents.
Exception: the top-level "globals" folder represents minor data.

Only two files are ever needed in a top-level folder:

contents_<key>: the contents of the file.
data_<key>: a dict representing the "minor data" of the file:
    <globals> element stuff, expansion bits, etc.

We write contents_<key> only once.
By definition, its contents never changes, since the contents generates the key.
We can write data_<key> as many times as we like.

To do:
- Simplify or even eliminate the path-manipulation code in PickleShareDB.
- Use g.makeAllNonExistentDirectories to make top-level directories.
- Clear cache should clear all top-level directories.

1. Memory does leak, and that's not ok with me.  And I want just two
files per top-level directory.

2. Strange things can happen with caching, as just happened to me when
I restored qtui_generate.py mistakenly deleted from leo/test.  There
is an @auto node for this file in qtGui.py, and I got improper 'can
not open' messages for this file.

3. It is troubling that the present caching scheme does not use the
full path to a file, only the basename.  This means that two identical
files in two different places will use the same cache entries.  I've
been wondering for the last several days about whether this could
cause problems.  I don't know for sure, but I am uncomfortable.

4. I want the clear-cache and clear-all-caches commands to do what
they say: get rid of everything.  Among other things, this is good for
debugging and recovering from cache problems.

This is a recent bug, but imo it has uncovered some other caching buglets. These
buglets are not big enough to delay Leo 4.7, but the new caching scheme would
ensure they never bite.

1. The code that computes what I have been calling the top-level directory is dubious::

    dbdirname = join(g.app.homeLeoDir,'db',
            '%s_%s' % (bname,hashlib.md5(fn).hexdigest()))

The problem is that bname is only the base name of the cached file, not a name
(or key) that depends on the full path. Thus, two copies of the same file in the
same place will be cached in the same directory. Is this ominous?

2. It's not clear what caching to do with the save-to command.

@nocolor

The main difficulty I see in the migration is creating the tables in the getPublicCommands methods in the various classes in leoEditCommands.py.  At present, these tables associate command names (strings) with corresponding methods.  The form of getPublicCommands is always:

def getPublicCommands (self):
  return {
    'command-name1': self.methodName1,
    'command-name2': self.methodName2,
    ...
  }

Thinking out loud, let's see whether the migration can be done easily.  We would change the entry:

    'command-name1': self.methodNameN,

to:

    'command-name1': self.classNameN(self),

That is, the table creates an instance of the class by calling the class's ctor, with self (the container object) as the ctor's only argument.  To make this work, all we need to do is give the class a __call__ method whose signature matches the signature of methodNameN, that is, the signature used to call methods previously.

Well, isn't this nice.  We can transition gradually, as needed.  No need *ever* to do a mass migration.  It should be easy to verify this scheme with one or two examples.  Please report your experiences if you decide to play around with this.

Edward

P.S.  I think it would be good style to append "Class" to the name of each command class. This makes it clear that self.myCommandClass(self) is a ctor.

What uA should be used to specify node colors?

if the foreground / background color API uses uAs,
would/should the uAs use the reserved "leo_&lt;something&gt;"
namespace?

-------------------

Terry Brown

Sounds like something I may have brought up, long ago.

I was thinking that setting the fore/background color of nodes in the
tree should be a "gui core" function, and that the info should be
stored in uA, and so wanted to know what key should be used in uA for
that.  I think the docs say top level keys starting with "leo_" are
reserved, and probably wanted a ruling on

v.u['leo_fg'] = 'red'

vs

v.u['leo_tree_style']['fg'] = 'red'

etc.

I think the question may be more complicated than just what to call the
key, so you can probably retire the todo item.

A reminder, the opposite of "light" is "heavy", not "dark" :-)

Leo's print-settings, print-commands and print-bindings commands
create too much text.

Suppose they created outline nodes instead, replacing existing nodes
if they exist.  Something like this:

- Reference (Anywhere you like)
 - @print-settings
    etc.
 - @print-bindings
   etc
 - @print commands
   etc

Doh!  This uses Leo's power.  The subnodes can be as voluminous as
desired, and there can be organizer nodes in each case.  The actual
tree could be specified as in @menus.

Etc., etc.  This could moot the need for separate apropos commands.
Conversely, apropos commands could create their own trees, or
subtrees.

This could be the tip of an iceberg.

The more I think about the light/heavy distinction, the more I think
it is getting close to what makes Leo special.  For example, clones
(and nodes, for that matter) drastically lighten the apparent
complexity of programs or data.

This way could be said to be much better than all.bat: nothing gets
loaded until needed.  Therefore, even more files could be added.

Imo, URL's in bookmark trees should support {{expression}} notations.

For example, I want the following to work in the body text of a node
in an @bookmarks tree::

file://{{g.os_path_finalize_join(g.app.loadDir,'..','doc','LeoDocs.leo').replace('\\','/')}}

Not bad, eh?  Or maybe the URL logic should do the replace('\\','/')
automatically...

Got to go.  We are nearing a tipping point in Leo's workflow...

http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=2903742
By: nobody

In the multifile plugin there is an option to insert a directory string.  I
use it alot for the @path directive.  What happens is that when executed a FileDialog
opens up and the user selects the directory he wants to use as a directory string.
When chosen the directory string is inserted into the text editor.

The good of this:
1. It makes using path simpler, you dont have to type out the directory path
yourself, just use the tkFileDialog to select it and have Leo insert the string.
For long directories this saves a lot of typing.

simple, short and quite helpful.  Thoughts? :)

Leo's file format: version 3, draft 5

This draft is intended to reflect minimal changes from Leo's
present file format, but with improvements mentioned at the
Ashland sprint and developed afterward.

This draft covers only Leo's xml format, but it may be adapted
for use as a json file format.

This draft contains significant invention by EKR. See the next
section. Don't panic: it can be changed :-)

Summary of changes from draft 4
===============================

- Elements will be renamed as follows::

    old         new
    ====        ====
    <vnodes>    <directed-acyclic-graph>
    <tnodes>    <data-list>
    <v>         <node>
    <t>         <data>

- Nesting of <node> elements represents the structure of the DAG,
  just as nesting of <v> elements does at present.
  
- Thus, there will be no <edge> elements.

- Headlines will move from <v> elements to <data> elements.
  This "normalizes" the data: headlines will appear only once.
  
- <attr> elements will represent uA's.  A full discussion below.

  Ideally, I would like to support only string and json formats
  for <attr> elements.  This is open to discussion. 

- Only <node> elements will contain <attr> elements.

- <node> elements for @file nodes will contain
  <at-file-attributes> elements, representing Leo's "hidden
  machinery" attributes.  <at-file-attributes> will contain
  <attr> elements. 

First lines
===========

Leo file will start with the following::

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <?xml-stylesheet my_stylesheet?>
    <!-- Created by Leo (http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/front.html) -->
    <leo_file file_format="3"
        xmlns:leo="http://www.leo-editor.org/2011/leo"/>
        

No session data
===============

There will be no <globals>, <preferences> or
<find_panel_settings> elements. All such "session data" will be
restored from the cache, or from defaults if caching is disabled.

**Important**: there is no representation of expansion state or
the currently selected node anywhere in the .leo file.
Eliminating these data is contingent on having Leo work well with
caching disabled.

Note: marks are more than session data. They must appear within
<node> elements.


Summary of format
=================

.leo files will have the following form, with similar indentation::

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <?xml-stylesheet my_stylesheet?>
    <!-- Created by Leo (http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/front.html) -->
    <leo_file file_format="3" xmlns:leo="http://www.leo-editor.org/2011/leo"/>
    <directed-acyclic-graph>
        <node id="gnx">
            <!-- contained node elements, if any.
        </node>
        <node id="gnx">
            <!-- contained v elements, if any.
        </node>
        ...
    </directed-acyclic-graph>
    <data-list>
        <data id="gnx">
            <!-- marked attribute appears only if the tnode/vnode is marked -->
            <head>headline text</head>
            <attr key="marked">1</attr>
            <!-- uA's... -->
            <!-- format="string" is the default -->
            <attr key="a">a string</attr>
            <attr key="b" format="json">a json string</attr>
            <attr key="c" format="pickle">a pickled string</attr>
            <attr key="d" format="binhex">a binhexed string</attr>
            ...
            <body>body text</body>
        </data>
        ...
    </data-list>
    </leo_file>

<attr> elements
===============

<attr> elements will one of the following forms::

    <attr key="a">a unicode string</attr>
    <attr key="b" format="json">a json string</attr>
    <attr key="c" format="pickle">a json string</attr>
    <attr key="d" format="binhex">a binhexed string</attr>
    
The value will be a string by default.

If possible, I would like to support only the string and json
formats. This would make the data as transparent as possible.
Please mentally amend the following discussion...

uA's that start with "binhex_" will use the binhex format. This
prefix must be retained in the type field, so the read code can
restore them.

If the value is not a string, and there is no "binhex_" prefix,
the write code will use format="json" if json.dumps succeeds, and
will use format="pickle" otherwise.

No <attr> element will be written if both json.dumps and
pickle.dumps fail. Attribute failures will create a warning for
the plugin developer.
    
Descendant attributes in @file trees
====================================

Descendants of @file nodes do not appear in .leo files. Thus,
important data must be stored in the so-called hidden machinery:
attributes of the @file node.

The <at-file-attributes> element may optionally be contained in
the <node> element for @file nodes::

    <at-file-attributes>
        <attr>key="ua-name"
            format="(empty)/json/pickle/binhex"
            gnx="gnx">value

Leo's file format: version 3, draft 4

http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/a2b7e5321d62b64/a4cc51d404af94aa

Here is the latest version, with the graphml stuff removed.

This draft is intended to reflect our recent discussions, with no
new invention from me. All comments and corrections welcome.

This draft covers only Leo's xml format, but it may be adapted
for use as a json file format.

Recent changes
==============

- Removed graphml stuff, including leo: prefixes.

- Used "key" in <attr> elements (and "type" in <edge> elements.)

<attr> elements
===============

<attr> elements will one of the following forms::

<edge> elements
===============

<edge> elements will have the form::

    <edge type="child" from="gnx" to="gnx"/>
    
Leo will use type="child" to represent Leo's official edges.
Plugins are free to define any type except "child". Examples::

    <edge type="undirected" from="gnx" to="gnx"/>
    <edge type="bidirectional" from="gnx" to="gnx"/>
    <edge type="backlink" from="gnx" to="gnx"/>

The draft is also intended to be compatible with graphml.

for use as a json file format.

I am willing to change "type" to "key" in <edge> elements if that
would be preferable.

- Defined the leo namespace for leo-only elements.
    - Renamed <leo_file> to <leo:outline>
    - Renamed <descendant-attributes> to <leo:at-file-attributes>

- Used <leo:at-file-attributes> for marks, removing the special case.

<node> element for @file nodes. For compatibility with graphml,
it will enclosed in a data element::
    
    <data>
        <leo:at-file-attributes>

In other words, we use the graphml <attr> element, extended with the
gnx attribute, to represent all the uA's in the descendants of @file nodes.

It requires a translation layer, either to (un)munge the name or
(un)pickle. Real problem?

Let's say each time I think 'I can use UAs to store that' I change
my mind when I realize my values will be in a pickle. (I really don't
want to name all my attributes str_xxx)

How is it done in any other XML file?
I've not used XML for arbitrary data, but it probably can be done.

> Why would that way be better than pickle?

My suspicion is that UAs would be used more for
storing text and numbers (as seems common for XML files)
than Python data objects.

Does Leo use UAs to store pickles?

I'm sure pickling capability is great, but I'm not convinced
it should be the _default._

No big deal.

Other options I though would be really handy:

1. Use an existing node as a source also

2. Use an node from another Leo file.. I am not sure what the syntax for that
would be exactly

3. From a URL.. this would be really cool. People could post outlines not only
as existing Leo xml files, but as text files or even dynamic scripts. The code
to handle these would presumably need to deal with http:// intelligently. But
that's easy in Python. Rebol is great at that too.

4. Other XML file with valid filepaths in them.
That's probably a much bigger project like Leo 3.10

@nocolor
http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3583737
By: Offray

I was previously thinking in the relation between Leo and Wikis, and I think
that may be a thing that would help to make Leo more visible in Wiki space could
be if Leo can export/import to/from a Wiki (something limilar to th @file or
@url directives). Let me explain a little better the scenary where this idea
come.

We have a local wiki for colombian Free Software Community related issues, and
I have used Leo for writing the migration scripts from Mediawiki to MoinMoin
(wich I think is more flexible and extensible that the popular wiki behind
wikipedia). I was probing also the idea of a Wiki like environment for solving
colaborative problems, so I was posting the scripts I made on Leo in a Wiki
page, and republishing them in the moment they changed. This keeps me pasting
all the time the script and in some moments I was thinking what about if someone
make a change in the Wiki page. Would be nice then to have the same capability
to detect and sincronize that change as Leo make with the hard disk files.

But this doesnt end here. Another Wiki-Leo interaction is to use outlines as
a way to organice Wiki content. For example "= Title =" in a Wiki would be a
Outline Node in Leo and "== Subtitle ==" Would become a outline subnode all
arranged in the proper hierarchy.

Somekind of Wisiwyg display would be nice, but this must be a plugin or something
like that, so Leo could become a "Layered" front end to some kind of data.

About and article on Wikipedia. That would be nice, but I'm a little tired of
fighting with some wikipedians ignorance on certain matters combined with power
(a pretty bad combination). I think that a Wiki page is nice because its live
comes from the community knowledge, but I'm not interested in that fighting,
so I have made a Leo wiki page in our local Wiki:

http://www.el-directorio.org:8080/Leo

and when I have enough knowledge about Leo (and time) I hope to start making
contribs in the spanish documentation (for the moment I'm only workind in the
evangelism here).

moot as it will be with the new config options
and any undo changes on the table.
maybe there is a single point to involke clear 
undo that could be run from a button?

with py2.3 after allot of small edits on an open leo after a few hours gc can
hit unexpectedly and last several minutes
and return at any time lasting several more minutes.
I think its gc related because the memory use and disk grinding demanding I
free up memory or kill python.

I have no idea if undo is the cause,
 just guessing.
using cvs of last week. I just updated, 
will let you know if it happens again.
(new error reporting jump to error is great)

usually I don't edit in the same process that long.
I have run scripts from leo that run 6, 12 
or 24 hours no problem. 
maybe I can turn on some internals reporting and
get some feedback on whats going on from python if it happens again. 
or run the gc script before and after.

 win98 128meg w/maxmem memory defrager that works well.
but I go from 50% free to 10% when this starts happening.
I haven't noticed this problem yet in py2.4, and it is peppier,
but don't use py2.4 enough. it doesn't happen every day.
I reboot at least once a day for various reasons.
so it isn't that either. 
you do need to reboot and or exit python once it starts.
this was never an issue with py2.2 and Leo 4.1 or less with only 64 megs.
I don't really have any other long running python processes to compare to Leo. 
can't say what it is.
Aha, progress. 
this started sometime early in 4.2 or late 4.1
but I can still be persuaded something in my 
local system is to blame, some install or dll update. or script, psyco or plugin
related.

nonwithstanding, I should be taking better advantage Moore's law in my CPU and
memory.
I only notice this when I'm running the same leo over a few hours of constant
editing and running scrips.
and when I exit python and restart leo everything returns to normal.
more a supporting anomaly report 
than a bug report or feature request.

By: jasonic

-- pdf -- 
yes I know what you mean, PDF has it uses.  If nicely embedded into Leo via
'reportwriter'  and some export scripts {and clear useinterfance} would stillbe
a good thing.


As I start to think about how to print Leo, I become more aware of the differneces
between Leo structures and linear [print] layouts.

Different kinds of outlines obviously will need different kinds of printing.
I don't yet have enough experience or overview.

--xslt--
Seems a natural way to go for printing Leo, but yet another langauge and syntax
to wrassle with. Last time I looked I went from being horrified to very impressed
to be being exhausted.

--htmlize--
thanks I'll check into that

"print to web"  should definitely be on Leo's missing PRINT MENU.

--swf [flash]--
This printing topic pushes me harder to get FLC  [my FlashLeoClient project]
into the Leosphere.

Flash has*limited*  CSS handling, but enough to do some nice and useful typographic
formatting in a pretty clean object-oriented manner.

FLC parses .leo files into a Flash object. Flash Textformat instances are created
using CSS and can be applied then to rendering any parts of  the deserialized
Leo object.. The beauty is it can be very fast and ynamic so I can imagine a
real-time WYSIWYG laytou tool for printing Leo to web and at the same making
it suitable at the same time for print-to-paper.

Since FLC is in the very first instance a READ-ONLY client tool for Leo, it
makes it a natural Leo printing service.

To complete full service, it woudl be good if Leo could create SWF files directly
itself, just like using PDF reportwriter.
There are a couple of libraries to help this 
- Ming [with PHP, Perl, Python and Ruby wrappers]
http://ming.sourceforge.net/

- makeswf.r [interesting REBOL/Flash dialect by David Oldes]
http://sweb.cz/oliva.david/swf/

These could also be both configured as web-services.
So Leo print-to-web would include by default rendering a flash swf file versoin
of itself either using locally installed libraries or by passing a view of itself
to a chosen client or server-based tool.

But even without those extra 'services' and libraries a single flash file in
the form of FLC could become an effective Leo printing kit. Using a standalone
desktop  version [not embedded in the browser, out of the sandbox] much more
is possible - remote control, peer-peer editing, file writing etc.

-- flashpaper2--
btw, Lately I've been using Flashpaper2 a lot to print all kinds of stuff, Often
from web pages to my local adhoc home filebase. It's a very fast lighweight
alternative to PDF, saves paper, has excellent zooming and nice search features
built-in.
Flashpaper renders a very litteral snapshot, but as I am discovering that turns
out to be extremely useful.
For example you visit a page and click on some links. Flashpaper saves teh pages
exactly as it looks, viisted links disntinguished.  In the era of info-overload,
even that crude mnemonic is valuable.

Alas, Flashpaper2 is not free nor open in the way Leo is. But worth to play
with it if only for for the experience.
30 day trial downlaod from
http://www.macromedia.com/software/flashpaper/

And of course the flash _players_ is free, so can send people flashpaper documents
just like PDF.
Brilliant when you have a big Excel spreadsheet or CAD document which would
normally get all messy printing across pages, confusing people.
Instead adjust and print to a generous 'piece' of flashpaper - letting your
coleagues pan and zoom to their comfort.

I've not quite figured out the place where  Leo meets Flashpaper, because Leo
needs to preserve its full pane contents. Flashpaper works fine with long web
pages, automatically reading the full window contents and cutting into a paginated
sequence, ready for paper printing.
Leo's does not have aprint menu, so it's off the sytem's print-devices map,
which Flash paper appearing just  like any phtycial printer.

I imagine is possible to fix that in Leo, but I do not where to begin and woudl
not be surprised to learn its a major heachche to write adn debug for multiple
operating systems.

An immediate alternative are screencapture tools like vnc2swf or MDM Capture.

[vnc2swf uses Ming-0.2a]
http://www.unixuser.org/~euske/vnc2swf/

http://www.multidmedia.com/software/capture/index.php

But much is hidden or lost from view. 
Still very vauable for creating dynamic narrative tutorials [aka screencasting]

AS you know I am very excited about what flash can do for Leo, and vice versa.
But I am concerned that there is not yet a 100% Leo means which supports people's
standard print needs and habits.

-- PRINT MENU-- 
Leo deserves good friendly printing features which anyone can use. At the moment
we have a confusing patchwork of choices. Printing Leo seems to be both harder
and easier than  first meets the eye.

Having a little library of export scripts - well named, documented and intended
to aid printing woudl go a long way. Thesse scripts anyone coiuld be called
by onayone given a Leo Outline, accessing a navabr button. PRINT MENU or list.
Or they can just insert the appropriate script  into an outline giving finer
grained print control on the fly.

By: dsalomoni

Proposal: modify the code for @url so that if you type for example just "@url"
(no file specified) in a headline, a window pops up allowing you to browse the
local file system and select the file (similar to what browsers do when you
want to open a file).

This would be more convenient than manually writing @url
file://a/long/path/to/the/file. @read-only nodes already allow this, it would
perhaps be nice if all these types of plugins (@folder might be another one
for example) and directives (@file etc) had the same behavior (and this should
probably be specified in some guidelines for writing new plugins -see e.g. the
jedit plugin guidelines).

http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/014fe61ff9480b2b

I don't know if this is relevant or not, but the IPython autocompletion
capability is awesome.

If I'm investigating code I tend to do the following.

list the modules in a package:
In [1]: from fs import <tab>

this lists the modules, in a package so I pick one
In [1]: from fs import osfs
<the osfs entry is tab-completable>

now I can check the usage of fs.osfs
In [2]: osfs? <enter>

or the source:
In [2]: osfs?? <enter>

or the contents of the module
In [2]: osfs. <tab>

I can instantiate a class:
In [3]: myfs = osfs.OSFS('/')

and examine the ivars and methods:
In [4]: myfs. <tab>

It is such an efficient way to learn and remember the details of code.

I know a bunch of work was done on Leo/IPython integration, don't
know the current status, my wish of synchronized IPython and Leo
may well be one of the many granted wishes I have forgotten about.

I certainly think IPython autocompletion is the gold standard.

Hate to break into the grand design discussions, but here's a hopefully small thing. If you need to place a good sized copyright statement at the top of your files, LEO doesn't handle this case very cleanly. As I'm sure you're aware, you wind up with a matching number of @@first lines for each leading line in your source.

My fellow co-workers who don't use LEO, aren't exactly loving me here. 

Might we introduce an:

Type tag instead? So one '@@first 5' could represent all 5 of the above @@first lines? It makes for a smaller, cleaner LEO footprint and will tick off non-LEO users much less.

There's a literate programming mode in Haskell (and in a number of other
functional programming languages such as Clean & Curry), where the program is in
a comment, usually where the line starts with ">" (bird track style, I think
it's called), and the comments/documentation are freeform. It would be difficult
but cool if Leo could support it, if only because the sentinels in the derived

I will wait. Here's clarification, when you're ready for it:

All of my projects are stored on remote computers, and accessed via FTP. 
What I want is basically the ability to open up these projects directly 
through leo, instead of transferring the files manually between my computer 
and the computers that hold my projects, preferably through FTP.

My solution: A new menu item called 'FTP' or 'Remote'. Click on this, and an 
FTP dialog opens up, with an empty list of FTP sites, and the ability to add 
more. You select a site, and it brings up a list of files. You select a 
file, and it is added to your project. When you hit 'save', it automatically 
does an FTP send.

Python makes this a lot easier with the builtin module 'ftplib'. I'm sure 
there are similar things for C++. I hope you take this idea into 
consideration.

Thanks for all these comments.  I'll respond to them all here.

Clearly, we should be using a standard xml parser to read .leo files.

My present thoughts:

- I personally like human-readable headlines in <v> elements.

- I am open to putting headlines in <t> elements, as an indication that
tnodes do indeed contain headlines and body text.

- I am willing to consider only writing shared subtrees once.

Oh! (An Aha)  All these are preferences.  We can allow any combination of
these provided that headlines appear somewhere.

So that's clean.  This will happen in Leo 4.5.

http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/eb718b4c6d478ac0

I'm just getting started learning how to use Leo. Now, I'd like to use
it for some of my projects, but there's no chance that I can convert
everyone at work to using it, so putting sentinel-filled files in our
repository is out of the question. At the same time, my code looks
awfully bare without sentinels because the documentation ends up in
the section names, not the comments!

So, I was wondering if there's a convenient way to pull the section
names into a comment at the start of each section?

===============

Interesting question.  Am I correct in assuming you are using @nosent trees
to generate your files?  If so, it would be easy to add support for the
following options:

@bool write_section_comments_in_at_nosent_trees
@bool write_node_name_comments_in_at_nosent_trees

The first would write a sentinel consisting of only the section name;
the second would write a sentinel consisting only of the node's headline
(for nodes whose headline is not a section name).

These seem like they would be useful additions.  One can even imagine
corresponding Leo directives so that the comments could be turned on or off
within an @nosent tree.

What do you think?

That sounds like an excellent solution. Particularly the last bit --
if you could turn section-comments on and off as required, it would
become very convenient to use Leo to produce source that is intended
to also be read by non Leo users.

.. @+node:ekr.20080708192807.2: *7* << about this loop >>
@ This loop writes all output lines using a single writer:
new_private_lines_wtr.

The output lines come from two, and *only* two readers:

1. old_private_lines_rdr delivers the complete original sources. All
   sentinels and unchanged regular lines come from this reader.

2. new_public_lines_rdr delivers the new, changed sources. All inserted or
   replacement text comes from this reader.

Each time through the loop, the following are true:

- old_i is the index into old_public_lines of the start of the present
  SequenceMatcher opcode.

- mapping[old_i] is the index into old_private_lines of the start of
  the same opcode.

At the start of the loop, the call to copy_sentinels effectively skips
(deletes) all previously unwritten non-sentinel lines in
old_private_lines_rdr whose index is less than mapping[old_i].

As a result, the opcode handlers do not need to delete elements from
the old_private_lines_rdr explicitly. This explains why opcode
handlers for the 'insert' and 'delete' opcodes are identical.

Thanks for this report. I think it is important, and needs a good solution.

I dislike all these files being sprayed around the file system. I'd like to see
these files placed somewhere the ~/.leo directory. Is there a reason why this
would be a bad idea?

Similarly, we might also prefer to have shadow files place in, say,
~/.leo/shadow_files.

In both cases, I think we want to create files that indicate their location.
Either that, or mirror their location in (subdirectories) ~/.leo. In other
words, this is a general problem, and it would be good to have a robust, general
solution.

I think there could be quite a bit of interest in moving
the shadow files to their own tree, avoiding what might
be considered 'pollution' of a tree of files in @shadow nodes.

Edward has said that this would add a lot of complexity to Leo.

It seems that a VCS back end for Leo might simplify the
task of arbitrary shadow file location, as well as adding
versioning capability.


Those of us old enough to remember the Groucho Marx show will know what I am ...

bogomil
 to me

In order to relocate .leo_shadow directories in home dir, I have made
the following changes leoShadow.py:
1. Introduce new setting 'shadow_in_home_dir':
   x.ctor:
     ...
     self.shadow_prefix = c.config.getString('shadow_prefix') or ''

=>  self.shadow_in_home_dir = c.config.getBool('shadow_in_home_dir')
or False
    ...

2. Make the following line:
   x.shadowDirName and shadowPathName:
      ...
      fileDir = g.os_path_dirname(filename)

=>   if self.shadow_in_home_dir:
        fileDir = "//".join([baseDir, fileDir.replace(':','%')])

In this way I keep .leo_shadow dirs in a tree and it is ok if the user
reorgs the original tree.

=====================

Thanks for these suggestions.  I'll try them soon.

A few minor comments about the code.

>  self.shadow_in_home_dir = c.config.getBool('shadow_in_home_dir') or False

This works (because c.config.getBool returns None if the setting does
not exist). Thus, the "or False" part merely replaces None by False.
I prefer the following:

self.shadow_in_home_dir = c.config.getBool('shadow_in_home_dir',default=False)

>   if self.shadow_in_home_dir:
>         fileDir = "//".join([baseDir, fileDir.replace(':','%')])

This looks like a Windows-only solution because of ':'.  It might fail

tab-cycle-next makes the following not so important

There is a relationship here with mouseless
programming.  It would seem that all visual elements, especially those
that may exist in multiple versions, must have a name or other
description suitable for generalized commands.

The user might want multiple rendering panes, especially if
one or more are locked.  Without a description, there is no way to
specify exactly what show/hide-rendering pane does.

I haven't forgotten the autocompleter docs.  I'll get to them next.
It looks like autocompletion would be the way to generalize the not-
very-effect commands that switch focus from one ui element to
another.  A related benefit is one generalized command might be more
convenient to use than the present flavors of (buggy) cycle-focus
commands.

In short, contemplating generalized windows leads us to generalized
select/delete/show/hide commands, based on autocompletion, that work
on various ui elements.  This looks like the next project.

I've some more information about the problems with accent previously
reported:
- I can confirm that they are caused by the interaction scim+leo (with
and without the qt plugin). If scim is not started leo works fine. If
scim is running the problems appear and are slightly different with
and without the qt plugin. The workaround is obvious: don't use leo
and scim at the same time :-)
- accents are not working in the qt plugin when scintilla is used. If
qt-use-scintilla=False I can write this:

àáä (the same for the rest of vowels)

but if qt-use-scintilla=True when I enter the same sequence in the
keyboard I get:

`aaa (the same for the rest of vowels)

- the problem with the ñ character (reported previously too) is only

The following applies to Leo 4.3, which is in alpha as I write this. It describes
the LeoSetup routine that I submitted to Edward to solve the "can't find Python"
problem, and which Edward cleaned up for distribution.

I think a few further issues need attention. I noticed them while working on
the "can't find Python" problem, and deferred dealing with them. This appears
to me to be a good time to pick them up.

Before I start work on them, I would like to lay them out for your comment.
Are they pains in the first place? Are my proposals good enough, and do they
make sense?

Issue 1. LeoSetup still thinks Leo's user is an Administrator who owns the whole
machine.

For explanation, let's say that I log on as David to Windows 2000 or Windows
XP and install Leo 4.3. You then log out. You log in as Edward, and click Start,
pick Programs... you have no visible entry for Leo!

The current Setup routine allows no one but David to use Leo on this computer.
To make things worse, when I go to use Leo, I have to log in to Windows using
the account under which I installed it, which has Administrator rights to the
computer. In other words, I can't use Leo without operating the computer in
a mode that leaves it needlessly vulnerable to security violations.

Issue 2. LeoSetup allows only one copy of Leo on a given computer. 

LeoSetup assumes that you want Leo in C:\Program Files\Leo. The installer can
override that already. LeoSetup also goes to some trouble to set up the usual
click-to-open behavior for .leo files. That behavior is tied to the copy of
Python that was current when I ran LeoSetup, and tied to the copy of Leo that
was installed most recently.

Proposal: While LeoSetup should allow all accounts to share the Python code
for core Leo and its plug-ins, my guess is that we don't want to enforce that,
since Leo is a programmer's tool and the individual programmer will wish to
modify Leo and its pieces for the programmer's use.

Proposal Option 1. Setup should ask whether to install Leo for everyone or for
the installer's account only. If the answer to that question is "yes," Setup
should give the user a private copy of everything that comes with Leo -- the
only application shared should be the current Python, assuming that it is installed
for all users.

Python.org's installer for Python 2.4 allows the installed Python to work only
for the account that installed it. I found this in December and wrote code to
handle it, which I then commented out since the issue wasn't critical. I can
check a computer with a single-account installation of Python in order to figure
out how a single-account installation of Leo would have to handle the click-to-open
behavior.

Proposal Option 2. When LeoSetup finds Python installed for that single user,
it should ask whether to install Leo for the installer's account only. If the
answer to that question is "yes," Setup should give the user a private copy
of everything that comes with Leo and use the single-user installation of Python.
Why does this matter. If you need to test your plug-ins with different versions
of Python, this would make that easier.

Issue 3. LeoSetup always installs Python MegaWidgets ("Pmw"), even on computers
whose installed Python installation already includes it.

Proposal: put up a dialog box and ask whether Setup should install Pmw  I do
not know whether doing this is a good idea.

Issue 4. LeoSetup does not run without human intervention. This complicates
deploying Leo in multi-computer sites.

The message box that displays the path of the Python installation found is one
issue. I put it in to allow the installer to cross-check Setup's behavior. Since
nobody has complained about problems with the code I wrote to fix the problem
installing with Python 2.4 and Active Python, Setup need no longer force the
installer to review the message box's contents.

Proposal: The message box needs to time out after, say, 15 seconds. 

I last looked at the installer three months ago so I would have to look at the
rest of it for other barriers to automated installation.

Let me know what you think. I won't be able to start work for a week or so,
so there's no rush.

.. @+node:ekr.20111018220642.15862: *3* Plugins
.. @+node:ekr.20111017132257.15882: *4* Study import_xml plugin
@language rest

http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/b5c2982778a2df53

Provides commands (Alt-x) for importing and exporting XML from a Leo
outline. These commands are to XML what ``@auto-rst`` is to
reStructuredText.

``xml2leo`` imports an .xml file into the node following the currently
selected node.  ``leo2xml`` exports the current subtree to an .xml file
the user selects.

``xml_validate``, if executed on the top node in the
Leo xml tree, reports any errors in XML generation or DTD validation,
based on the DTD referenced from the XML itself.  If there's no DTD
it reports that as an error.

``leo2xml2leo`` takes the selected Leo subtree representing an XML file,
converts it to XML internally, and then creates a new Leo subtree from
that XML after the original, with 'NEW ' at the start of the top node's
name.  This updates all the headlines, so that the convenience only
previews (see below) are updated.  The original can be deleted if the
new subtree seems correct.

Conventions
===========

This is a valid XML file::

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE dml SYSTEM "dml.dtd">
    <?xml-stylesheet href="common.css"?>
    <dml xmlns='http://example.com/' xmlns:other='http://other.com/'/>
      <block type='example'>Here's <other:b>some</other:b> text</block>
    </dml>
    <!-- This is the last line -->

Note the processing instruction (xml-stylesheet), the DTD (DOCTYPE),
the trailing comment (after the closing tag), and the pernicious
mixed content (three separate pieces of text in the ``<block/>`` element).
These commands attempt to deal with all of this.

 - A top level Leo node is created to hold these top level parts.  Its
   headline is the basename of the file.
 - The xml declaration is placed in the body of
   this top level Leo node
 - Below that, in the same body text, appears a simple namespace map::

     http://example.com/
     other: http://other.com/
     ...

   i.e. the default namespace first, and then any prefixed name spaces.
 - Below that, in the same body text, appears the ``DOCTYPE`` declaration
 - Children are added to this top level Leo node to represent the
   top level elements in the xml file.  Headlines have the following
   meanings:

       - ``? pi-target some="other" __CHK`` - i.e. questionmark,
         space, name of processing instruction target, start of processing
         instruction content.  Only the questionmark, which indicates
         the processing instruction, and the first word, which indicates
         the processing instruction target, matter.  The remainder is just
         a convenience preview of the processing instruction content, which
         is the Leo node's body text.

       - ``# This is *really* imp`` - i.e. hash,
         space, start of comment content.  Only the hash, which indicates
         the comment, matters.  The remainder is just
         a convenience preview of the comment content, which
         is the Leo node's body text.

       - ``tagname name_attribute start of element text`` - i.e. the name
         of an element followed by a convenience preview of the element's
         text content.  If the element has a ``name`` attribute that's
         included at the start of the text preview.  Only the first word
         matters, it's the name of the element.

 - Element's text is placed in the Leo node's body.  If the element has
   tailing text (the ``" text"`` tailing the ``<other:b/>`` element
   in the above example), that occurs in the Leo node's body separated
   by the `tailing text sentinel`::

       @________________________________TAIL_TEXT_______________________________

 - Element's attributes are stored in a dict ``p.v.u['_XML']['_edit']``
   on the Leo node. ``'_XML'`` is the uA prefix for these commands, and
   ``'_edit'`` is used by the ``attrib_edit`` plugin to identify
   attributes it should present to the user for editing. The
   ``attrib_edit`` plugin **should be enabled** and its ``v.u mode``
   activated (through its submenu on the Plugins menu). The attribute
   edit panel initially appears as a tab in the log pane, although it
   can be moved around by right clicking on the pane dividers if the
   ``viewrendered`` and ``free_layout`` plugins are enabled.

@nocolor-node

Almost from day one, Leo has defined gui base classes in the core, and
subclasses in gui plugins.

I plan to continue that organization, but I would like to remove some of the
wrapping layers if possible. The present scheme has one or two too many
redirection layers, and they are more of a nuisance than a help.

One idea would be to define **interface classes** that define the desired api's.
Unit tests could test that subclass implements the interface class, without
having to resort to quite as much error-prone machinery as at present.

@nocolor
http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3578252
By: bwmulder

I have been thinking for a while that it ought to be possible to somehow  to
unite Leo with wiki features (my thinking is still vague at this point).

If you look at systems like Tiddlywiki (http://www.tiddlywiki.com/) you will
find that they already pretty much provide all the formatting features mentioned
in the article.

MoinMoin, another wiki (http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de), has started to use
a graphical interface for editing in the latest version.

Maybe Leo can be split up into three components:

1. A storage component is responsible for storing nodes. Currently, this is
just memory, but databases like shelve, Zope or sqllite should also be possible.

2. The control component is responsible for converting from the internal format
to external files which can be processed by existing compilers, searching within
a document, and the like.

3. A display component is responsible for interfacing with the user. If can
be TK, but it can also be something like the Tiddlywiki interface, which immediately
shows the formatting applied to text.

I don't know much about javascript, so I would have to learn more about this
language before doing anything in this direction.

As an intermediate step, maybe we could allow mixing RST processing with regular
program text.  Leo would produce two documents out of a source file: a version
for the compiler in plain ascii, and an HTML file for reading the source.

@nocolor-node

Getting value from Bret Victor's video

http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/9e1785ba4f57faf8

Thus, to associate code with unit tests, we need only create a
convention for associating source code with nodes.  But clones make
this trivial to do!

- @interactive-unit-tests
 - @itest
   - @test spam
   - (clone of) spam

This is all we would need to "declare" that @test spam should be run
whenever the spam node changes!

These are just first thoughts, made up as I am writing this post.  But
clearly, Leo can do more in this area.

P.S. I think a feature that could make Leo *the* IDE for developing in 
interpreted languages is something like the (X)Emacs comint-mode.el for 
interacting with the shell and interpreters.

comint-mode.el serves as the basis for interactive modes for a number of
languages--OCaml, Haskell, SML, among them. It allows for editing expressions in
one buffer and triggering their evaluation in another buffer that has an
interpreter running in it, along with entering commands in the interpreter
buffer and moving back and forth through the history of their evaluation.

Imagine being able to highlight a node in Leo, and have all the code in it and
its children evaluated in an interpreter running in a separate window or pane,
much as Leo can open a Python shell now. Users of those languages could build
plug-ins specific to their language atop that layer, and the @language directive
could activate that. I think that would be very cool.
.. @+node:ekr.20071004120359.2: *6* expand-region-abbrev
See: regionalExpandAbbrev.

You may wish to expand an abbrev with a prefix attached; for example, if `cnst'
expands into `construction', you might want to use it to enter `reconstruction'.
It does not work to type recnst, because that is not necessarily a defined
abbrev. What you can do is use the command M-' (abbrev-prefix-mark) in between
the prefix `re' and the abbrev `cnst'. First, insert `re'. Then type M-'; this
inserts a hyphen in the buffer to indicate that it has done its work. Then
insert the abbrev `cnst'; the buffer now contains `re-cnst'. Now insert a
non-word character to expand the abbrev `cnst' into `construction'. This
expansion step also deletes the hyphen that indicated M-' had been used. The
result is the desired `reconstruction'.

If you actually want the text of the abbrev in the buffer, rather than its
expansion, you can accomplish this by inserting the following punctuation with
C-q. Thus, foo C-q , leaves `foo,' in the buffer.

.. @+node:ekr.20111010122531.15568: *5* @render-rest, @render-html trees
@language rest

The free_layout and viewrendered plugins are a huge step forward.  But
the lighter/heavier distinction suggests a new way to use them.

Suppose Leo supports @render-rest or @render-html.

This means that all nodes in the tree will have the body pane become a
rendering pane for rST or html.

Imagine LeoDocs completely rendered at all times.

Of course, for specific purposes, say in Leo's scripting chapter, we
might want to override these rendering directives (which should be
allowed in headlines too) with @no-render.

The point is that having *both* the original text *and* the rendered
text be visible is often too heavy: the user usually does not want to
know about the sources: the rendering is good enough.

I suppose for sophisticated users, something like show/hide-body pane
would be good commands to have, but that doesn't matter: those
commands to not increase the burden on the user while she is reading
the (rendered) docs.

 I Have a (maybe) great idea!   
2004-02-15 04:29

I've been using LEO for a while and finding surprinsingly powerfull new uses now
and then, (hey, not a week passes that i dont think to myself : "why did'nt
anyone thought of that kind of tool that is LEO. It's so stupid to program such
a tool, yet no one thought of doing such a thing ! ")

I was wondering if there was a leo keyword (beginning with "@") that would do a
feature I thought would be great: something such as :
@h
@endh
and of course, similarily...
@f
@endf

Standing for "Header", "End Header", "Footer" and "End Footer". Let me please explain ...

When creating files with @file (or nosentinels) I use the keyword "@others" in
the starting node body of the file and place in the file, as it's decendants
(children, grand-children & so on) some clones of other stuff somewhere else
outside of this file (usualy, clones of parts of program regrouped as children
of a "components" node up in the leo outline. Typical Example:

-Introduction
-+components
-a
-b
-c
-+@file program.BAS
-b
-c
-a

a, b, and c are clones and the @file node contains @others.

As you see, I proceed that way because in older programming languages or in
lower level languages, the order of components such as procs, declarations, etc
as an importance. It also has the implication that << and >> brackets are
irrelevant in my way of using leo.

Now, my feature that I looked for in the doc but could not find (so i suggest it
here in case no one had any need of this before) is that when used in the BODY
of a node part of an "@file" the @h and @endh would define a chunk of text in
the body, you've guessed it, to be added before _each_ children node and ONLY
children no grandchildren or any deeper. But It could also be used INSIDE the
body of a children to define headers or footers for IT'S OWN direct children.

so, eehh, do you see the relevance of such a feature? Have i explained it
clearly? maybe this would help:'

CONST baba=2 AS INTEGER
CONST bebe=7 AS INTEGER
CONST zaza=5 AS INTEGER
CONST bobo=1 AS INTEGER
... the beginning and end of each of those "parts-of-a-program" is the same for a potential lot of lines... 

To Be Precise : It's just really for adding something at end or beginning of a
direct children of a node part of an @file in the tangling process.

Is this feature already implemented but i have not found it? I'm pretty sure it easy to implement... what do you people think of this?
Thanks 
--
k

p.s. I'm the guy who proposed that in the untangling process, a clone would not
be updated by it's _Last-Instance-Found_ in the @file beeing untangled, but
instead updated by the _Last-Modified-One-Found_ in the @file... :)

Well, personally I'd like to have them included in the definition, but I think
Kent's preference for a separate node is reasonable to. If your function and
hence definition node is called "pluralize", and it's decorated with something
like "@authenticate_user", you may never check the innocent looking pluralize
definition to find out what on earth's triggering the mysterious network
database call. And this isn't a completely specious example, authentication may
have been added to stop pluralize being used in a user existence detection
exploit or something. OTOH in well behaved code like CherryPy apps you don't
want a separate node for every @cherrypy.expose.

Bottom line is I think we're asking for a set of @settings to fine tune python
import behavior:

@python_import_interdef = previous | next | own_node | ai
@python_import_decoration = next | own_node

I'm not sure I believe the AI option is possible / practical, and am not asking
for it, just listing it :-)

I'd also like

@python_import_init_in_class_node = true | false

as often there's more docs on a class in the __init__ than the class docstring.

I think that's really all we're talking about, some @settings to test during import.

After having @bool swap_mac_keys = True, I can use C-e.

C-a move the cursor to the start of line, but C-e seems to move the
cursor the first of the next line, which is the end of last line + 1.
If the line is the final one, C-e moves the cursor to the end of line
as there's no next line.

The patch is for 8.4.2.  If you have a different version, you can probably figure
out the changes needed by looking at the patch file.  If not, let me know your
version and I may be able to produce a patch for it.

Note: If you use tabs for anything other than leading whitespace, you will find
this patch really helpful.  I make lots of little tables when I'm documenting
or note-taking ... this fix really helped my sanity when making those tables
inside Leo.

-- Tabs are not expanded correctly in .c files, when language in preferences is set to c, and when the tabs occur in the middle of a line. The tabs are expanded as spaces until the next tab location is reached, then the tabs are expanded correctly. 
.. @+node:ekr.20040105070023.5: *6* Report 2
Leo 4.1 rc3, build 1.62 , December 19, 2003
Python 2.3.0, Tk 8.4.2
Linux 2.4.22-21mdkenterprise

1. Any tab typed before the first tab stop behaves correctly (the cursor is moved to the tab stop). Good.

2. Any tab typed after a non-tab character (even a space) _and_ after the first tab stop position doesn't behave like a tab and doesn't move the cursor to the next tab stop. Bad.

3. Any tab typed after a tab character will behave properly no matter what position on the line. Okay.

To reproduce this, set your global tab prefernence to 4. Show invisibles. And then create a node containing:

[BEGIN BODY TEXT]
@language plain
@tabwidth 8
[END BODY TEXT]

Create a child node to that one, containing:

[BEGIN BODY TEXT]
@root-code somefilename
\t\tThis works
bbb\tAnd This works
So\tdoes this

But, this \tdoes not.
Here is the two-tab \t\t behavior.
[END BODY TEXT]

I hope this is a Leo bug and not a Tk bug.

This is a test line.
put the text insertion point in the space between 'a' and 'test' above. Enter 3 tabs in a row and watch it not work.

If your expansion works correctly, then maybe something with leoconfig?  But wait, Im using the leoconfig from the beta download.

This has been and continues to be a known issue with Tk. Has been logged as a
bug; no response from the Tk folks.

Here is a link to the Tk bug report:

Note the work-around/patch in the followup post at the bottom of that page. Commenting out some statements in text.tcl removes the problem. 
.. @+node:ekr.20040220110030: *5* Change cursor when caps lock is down
@nocolor

http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=2431552
By: nobody

From: Rich

 I just got nipped twice by the following effect: the Caps-Lock key is ON, but
because the LED is on the Caps-Lock key, it is hidden behind my hand. I hit
Ctrl-x, expecting to cut my selection, but the entire node is cut.

   I know there's a problem with tk and the shift key status, so I'm wondering
if it would be possible to change the shape of the cursor when the Caps-Lock
is ON (preferrably a big red flashing blot 8-), or otherwise show that Caps-Lock
is active ( "CAPS" on a status line, for instance).

  Another way: I don't know if this goes against an "anti-modalism rule," but
only allowing Ctrl-Shift-x|c|v in the outline pane would also be acceptable
to me.

@ 
This document demonstrates what appears to be a bug in Leo 4.1 rc3, build 1.62 of December 19, 2003.

It has manifested when Leo is executed under Python 2.3.3, Tk 8.4.3 under Windows 2000.

In brief, derived XML files are not well-formed with respect to comments under some conditions.  Comments can wind up nested, which looks okay to humans but not to XML parsers.

This will produce, in the derived file, an XML comment with another XML comment
embedded. Or, if you prefer, it will produce an unclosed XML comment followed by
a well-formed one, followed by a string of text containing a comment-close
marker.

This text is sitting in the inner comment, according to the first view.

This comment is well-formed, seemingly because its content does not begin on the
