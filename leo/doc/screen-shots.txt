.. @+node:ekr.20100821182153.4350: *4* Leo is a free program
Leo is a free program distributed under the MIT license. This means that not
only can you use the program freely including commercially, the full
installation comes with source code that you can modify as you wish, as long as
you give credit to the author of the program, `Edward K. Ream`_.

Leo is written in Python--a full featured, powerful programming language that
is comparatively easy to learn and use. For an excellent introduction to Python
for non-programmers, see the `Python Tutorial`_. Not only is Leo written in Python, it is
scriptable via Python, meaning that you can embed Python commands in your
outlines and execute them.

Leo is under active development and all are welcome to contribute. For more
information, see the `leo-editor`_ Google Group.

.. @+node:ekr.20100821182153.4351: *4* Leo
Leo is a unique, powerful computer program that you can use to organize, analyze
and describe text and text files. Leo is a free program written by Edward K.
Ream. For information about downloading Leo, see installation tutorial in this
series. Leo runs on Windows, Mac, or Linux.

Use Leo:

- to brainstorm a new project
- as a Personal Information Manager
- to add multiple outlines and commentary to any text file
- as a tool to facilitate a new kind of programming.

Because Leo is unlike other tools you may have used, a series of examples may be
the best way to demonstrate what can be done with Leo.
