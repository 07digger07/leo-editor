.. @+node:ekr.20100821182153.4351: *3* Leo
Leo is a unique, powerful computer program that you can use to organize, analyze
and describe text and text files. Leo is a free program written by Edward K.
Ream. For information about downloading Leo, see installation tutorial in this
series. Leo runs on Windows, Mac, or Linux.

Use Leo:

- to brainstorm a new project
- as a Personal Information Manager
- to add multiple outlines and commentary to any text file
- as a tool to facilitate a new kind of programming.

Because Leo is unlike other tools you may have used, a series of examples may be
the best way to demonstrate what can be done with Leo.
