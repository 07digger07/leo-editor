Windows Users:

    Installing Leo requires two steps:

    1. Install Python: download the Windows MSI installer (a .msi file) from
       `the Python web site`_, and double-click on the installer. (Python is a
       type of software for creating and running computer programs.)

    2. Install Leo: download Leo's executable installer (an .exe file) from
       `Leo's download page`_, then double-click on the .exe file.

Unix and Mac Users:

    Please continue to next page.

Also, if you are a programmer and want to get the Leo files without using an
installer, continue to the next page.
