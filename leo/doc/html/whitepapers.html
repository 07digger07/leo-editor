<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id1" id="tk-is-the-future-of-leo" name="tk-is-the-future-of-leo">Tk is the future of Leo</a></h1>
<p>The more I look at Tk, the more convinced I am that Python + Tk (aka Tkinter)
is, by far, the best way to go with Leo. I now have Open Source code for tree
widgets and splitter windows, and have intensely studied how to modify that code
for use in Leo. It is clear, even at this early date, that this code will
provide a very pleasant base on which to build Leo.</p>
<p>The tree code is based on code in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">IDLE</span></tt>, the Python IDE. This code is simple,
good and plenty fast enough. The tree code draws directly to a Tk canvas object.
The look and feel matches Windows exactly. It would be trivial to use Mac
triangle icons instead of the Windows plus and minus icons. It would also be
trivial to modify the look and feel for Linux.</p>
<p>The tree widget code solves several intractable problems with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">wxTreeCtrl</span></tt>.
Moving nodes becomes trivial. Bugs in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">wxTreeCtrl</span></tt> involving editing and
redrawing disappear. Using Python/Tk code simplifies the vnode class, and having
access to the vnode class simplifies and speeds up the tree widget code. It will
now be possible to bind keystrokes properly; this simply can not be done in
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">wxWindows</span></tt>. The tree widget code shows just how trivial the Windows native
tree control is. The Tk canvas is a splendid example of higher-level code being
superior, in every way, to lower level code.</p>
<p>Another big win comes from using the Tk text widget. This widget is
extraordinarily powerful. The only text control that rivals it is the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MacOS/Yellow</span> <span class="pre">Box</span></tt> text control. Indeed, the Tk text widget does everything that
Leo could possibly want. One can even embed images in text.</p>
<p>In short, using Tk for Leo will be fast enough and will greatly increase what is
possible in Leo while at the same time greatly simplifying Leo's code. I am
about to convert Leo from wxPython to Python + Tk.

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2" id="why-i-like-python" name="why-i-like-python">Why I like Python</a></h1>
<p>I've known for a while that Python was interesting; I attended a Python
conference last year and added Python support to Leo. But last week I got that
Python is something truly remarkable. I wanted to convert Leo from wxWindows to
wxPython, so I began work on c2py, a Python script that would help convert from
C++ syntax to Python. While doing so, I had an Aha experience. Python is more
than an incremental improvement over Smalltalk or C++ or objective-C; it is
&quot;something completely different&quot;. The rest of this post tries to explain this
difference.</p>
<div class="section">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3" id="clarity" name="clarity">Clarity</a></h2>
<p>What struck me first as I converted C++ code to Python is how much less blah,
blah, blah there is in Python. No braces, no stupid semicolons and most
importantly, <em>no declarations</em>. No more pointless distinctions between
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">const</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">char</span> <span class="pre">*</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">char</span> <span class="pre">const</span> <span class="pre">*</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">char</span> <span class="pre">*</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">wxString</span></tt>.
No more wondering whether a variable should be <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">signed</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">unsigned</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">short</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">long</span></tt>.</p>
<p>Declarations add clutter, declarations are never obviously right and
declarations don't prevent memory allocation tragedies. Declarations also hinder
prototyping. In C++, if I change the type of something I must change all related
declarations; this can be a huge and dangerous task. With Python, I can change
the type of an object without changing the code at all! It's no accident that
Leo's new log pane was created first in Python.</p>
<p>Functions returning tuples are a &quot;minor&quot; feature with a huge impact on code
clarity. No more passing pointers to data, no more defining (and allocating and
deallocating) temporary structs to hold multiple values.</p>
<p>Python can't check declarations because there aren't any. However, there is a
really nifty tool called Pychecker that does many of the checks typically done
by compilers. See <a class="reference" href="http://pychecker.sourceforge.net/">pychecker</a> for details.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4" id="power" name="power">Power</a></h2>
<p>Python is much more powerful than C++, not because Python has more features, but
because Python needs <em>less</em> features. Some examples:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Python does everything that the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) does,
without any of the blah, blah, blah needed by STL.
No fuss, no muss, no code bloat.</li>
<li>Python's slicing mechanism is very powerful and applies to any sequence (string, list or tuple).
Python's string library does more with far less functions because slices replace many functions
typically found in other string libraries.</li>
<li>Writing dict = {} creates a dictionary (hash table).
Hash tables can contain anything, including lists and other hash tables.</li>
<li>Python's special functions,  <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__init__</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__del__</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__repr__</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__cmp__</span></tt>, etc.
are an elegant way to handle any special need that might arise.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5" id="safety" name="safety">Safety</a></h2>
<p>Before using Python I never fully realized how difficult and dangerous memory allocation is in C++.
Try doing:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
aList[i:j] = list(aString)
</pre>
<p>in C.  You will write about 20 lines of C code.
Any error in this code will create a memory allocation crash or leak.</p>
<p>Python is fundamentally safe. C++ is fundamentally unsafe. When I am using
Python I am free from worry and anxiety. When I am using C++ I must be
constantly &quot;on guard.&quot; A momentary lapse can create a hard-to-find pointer bug.
With Python, almost nothing serious can ever go wrong, so I can work late at
night, or after a beer. The Python debugger is always available. If an exception
occurs, the debugger/interpreter tells me just what went wrong. I don't have to
plan a debugging strategy! Finally, Python recovers from exceptions, so Leo can
keep right on going even after a crash!</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6" id="speed" name="speed">Speed</a></h2>
<p>Python has almost all the speed of C. Other interpretive environments such as
icon and Smalltalk have clarity, power and safety similar to Python. What makes
Python unique is its seamless way of making C code look like Python code.
Python executes at essentially the speed of C code because most Python modules
are written in C. The overhead in calling such modules is negligible. Moreover,
if code is too slow, one can always create a C module to do the job.</p>
<p>In fact, Python encourages optimization by moving to higher levels of
expression. For example, Leo's Open command reads an XML file. If this command
is too slow I can use Python's XML parser module. This will speed up Leo while
at the same time raising the level of the code.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7" id="conclusions" name="conclusions">Conclusions</a></h2>
<p>Little of Python is completely new. What stands out is the superb engineering
judgment evident in Python's design. Python is extremely powerful, yet small,
simple and elegant. Python allows me to express my intentions clearly and at the
highest possible level.</p>
<p>The only hope of making Leo all it can be is to use the best possible tools. I
believe Python (possibly with Tkinter) will allow me to add, at long last, the
new features that Leo should have.</p>
<p>Edward K. Ream, October 25, 2001.  P.S., September, 2005:</p>
<p>Four years of experience have only added to my admiration for Python. Leo could
not possibly be what it is today without Python.</p>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8" id="allocating-storage-using-lifetimes" name="allocating-storage-using-lifetimes">Allocating storage using lifetimes</a></h1>
<p>This white paper describes the storage allocation used in a commercial
optimizing C compiler written for Tuple, Inc. ca. 1993. The last section
discusses tantalizing possibilities for the pypy project. These possibilities
are why I wrote this paper.</p>
<p>Storage allocation is crucial to any compiler because of the number, size and
complexity of data which must be allocated. You might event say that a compiler
consists of storage allocation and everything else. I paid a lot of attention to
storage allocation in CC2, and that work paid off. The resulting compiler was a
few percent faster than the CodeWarrior C compiler, perhaps the fastest C
compiler in existence at that time. The original notes were written around 1993,
so I would do some things differently today. However, the design discussed below
still seems relevant today. Indeed, attention to low-level details can make a
huge difference.</p>
<div class="section">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9" id="lifetime-allocation" name="lifetime-allocation">Lifetime allocation</a></h2>
<p>CC2 allocated objects one-at-a-time (simple allocation), in blocks of
fixed-sized objects (block allocation) or in blocks of variable-sized objects
(lifetime-based allocation). Simple-allocation was used for short-lived objects
and will not be discussed further. Block allocation was used in several ways, the
most interesting of which was to allocate &quot;cons cells&quot; used to represent lists.
These cons cells could be reused by placing them on a global avail list. Thus,
the blocks holding cons cells could (and did) have permanent lifetime: they were
never deallocated.</p>
<p>The most interesting aspect of CC2's storage allocation scheme was what I
eventually came to call <strong>lifetime-based</strong> storage allocation. This was, for me,
an new discovery, though clearly I was not the first to discover it. The Aha is
that a lifetime is defined by the time (or equivalently by the place in program
code) at which objects are <strong>deallocated</strong>. A lifetime may hold many different
kinds of objects that were allocated at many different times. The essence of
lifetime-based allocation is that <strong>the proper time to specify when an object
will be deallocated is when the object is created</strong>.</p>
<p>Lifetime-based allocation is a superb invention:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">It becomes an effective design tool. Thinking of objects in terms of their
lifetimes often shows the essence of a design problem.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">It can be used for any kind of object, regardless of its size or type.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">It reduces the number of calls to calloc and free by one or two orders of
magnitude over naive schemes. Furthermore, it typically requests
standard-sized blocks (say 8K or more) from calloc, further easing the burden
on calloc and free.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">CC2 could allocate objects with a particular lifetime using small, extremely fast, macros.
The macros expanded to C code something like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
if lifetime -&gt; avail &gt;= sizeof(theObjectKind) {
    // Allocate the storage.
    theObject = lifetime -&gt; ptr
    lifetime -&gt; ptr += sizeof(theObjectKind)
}
else {
    &lt;&lt; allocate theObject in another block &gt;&gt;
}
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, the speed of the else clause makes absolutely no difference because
it is so seldom executed. Thus, it uses a function call. Clearly then, this code
is optimal: it could not be improved even if coded in assembly language.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10" id="typical-lifetimes" name="typical-lifetimes">Typical lifetimes</a></h2>
<p>What makes lifetime-based allocation so powerful is that so few lifetimes are
typically required. Indeed, CC2 had only the following lifetimes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Permanent: These objects were never deallocated. Examples were list pointers
held in cons cells and other kinds of application-wide objects.</li>
<li>Tokenizer: Tokenizing in C is complex due to C's various preprocessing
directives and macro expansion. Objects with tokenizer lifetime are
deallocated before the parser starts.</li>
<li>Function: Objects with function lifetime are deallocated after the compiler
generates code for the function.</li>
<li>File: Objects with file lifetime are deallocated after the compiler completes
a source file.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's all. Similarly, if Leo were recast as a C program only the following
lifetimes would be needed:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Permanent: application-wide objects.</li>
<li>Window/outline: All data associated with a single Leo outline. This is a
'semi-permanent' lifetime. Leo has unlimited undo, so it is essentially
impossible to delete any data object (an object that could be written to an
output file) until the entire outline closes.</li>
<li>Dialog: data associated with a temporary dialog.</li>
<li>Function/method: data not used outside a single function or method.</li>
</ul>
<p>The remarkable thing about dynamic languages like Python is how often objects
can, in fact, be assigned static lifetimes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11" id="implications-for-pypy" name="implications-for-pypy">Implications for pypy</a></h2>
<p>Lifetime allocation isn't used in Java, Python, etc. because these languages
have no way of knowing (in general) what the lifetime of any object will be.
Furthermore, translating Python to C would be straightforward were it not for
storage allocation issues. For example, most of Leo's code could easily be
translated into C, <strong>provided</strong> that the lifetime of all objects were known.
Again, just for example, the prospect of translating the Python version of Leo
to a fully optimized C version is tantalizing.</p>
<p>This is where pypy comes in: its extensive flow analysis may be sufficient to
discover lifetimes for a significant percentage of objects. Perhaps user hints
may be effective. For example, pypy offers the chance to make something like
<a class="reference" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region_inference">region inference</a> truly useful. Note that the pypy project might benefit from
deducing lifetimes even if not all objects could be assigned a static
lifetime. Another reason why lifetimes are not a standard technique is that they
are a potentially dangerous optimization. Errors in specifying lifetimes will
result in dangling pointer references. But this danger might disappear if pypy
could deduce lifetimes automatically.</p>
