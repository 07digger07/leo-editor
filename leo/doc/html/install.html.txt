This chapter tells how to install and run_ Leo.

**Important**:
    
If you have *any* problems installing Leo,
please ask for help on Leo's help forum:

System requirements
+++++++++++++++++++

Leo will work on any platform that supports Python 2.4 or later and Tk 8.4 or later.

-   Download the latest version of Leo from `Leo's download page`_.

-   Download Python from: http://python.org/

-   Most installations of Python have Tk pre-installed.
    If your doesn't, you may download it from: http://tcl.activestate.com/software/tcltk/
    
    **Warning**: When building Tcl on Linux, do **not** specify
    "--enable-threads".
    Only use Tcl with the default "threads not enabled" case.

-   Leo uses `Pmw`_ (Python Mega Widgets). Leo's extensions folder contains a copy
    of Pmw for use if needed. Leo first tries to import Pmw normally. If that
    fails, Leo will use the version of Pmw in the extensions folder.

Leo's HOME directory
++++++++++++++++++++

Python's HOME environment variable specifies Leo's HOME directory.
See http://docs.python.org/lib/os-procinfo.html for details.

Leo uses os.expanduser('~') to determine the HOME directory if no HOME environment variable exists.

Leo puts several files in your HOME/.leo directory:
.leoID.txt, .leoRecentFiles.txt, and myLeoSettings.leo.



How to install Leo on Linux
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Download the latest version of Leo (a .zip file) from `Leo's download page`_.
   
Unzip the downloaded .zip file into the **unpacked folder** in your home directory.
The unpacked folder will be called something like leo-4-5.

You now have two choices:
    
1. You can run Leo from your home directory.
   Just add  ~/leo-4-5 to your path.

2. You can install leo into /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/bin by running Leo's install script as follows::
    
    cd ~/leo-4-4-3-final
    chmod u+x install
    sudo ./install
    
The install script will instruct you to add /usr/local/bin to your path.
You can, instead, add the following link::

    sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib/leo/ /usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/

Now you are ready to `run Leo`_.


Installing Leo on Windows
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Leo is distributed either as an executable installer (.exe) file or as a .zip file.

To install Leo using the executable installer:
    
    1. Download the latest version of Leo's installer from `Leo's download page`_.
       The installer will be called something like LeoSetup-4-5.exe.
       
    2. Run the installer.
       By default, the install will install Leo an **unpacked folder** called something like Leo-4-5 in your ``Python\Lib\site-packages`` directory.

To install Leo from the .zip file:
    
    1. Download the latest version of Leo (a .zip file) from `Leo's download page`_.  

    2. Unzip the .zip file.  The **unpacked folder** will have a name like Leo-x-y,
       where x and y are version numbers.  For example, Leo-4-5 or Leo-4-5-b3.
    
    3. Place the unpacked folder in the 'Program Files' folder or any convenient location.
    
    4. Place the location of the unpacked folder to your python path.
       One way to do this is adding something like the following to python/Lib/sitecustomize.py::

        import sys
        sys.path.append(r'c:\Program Files\Leo-4-5')
            
Another way is to append the path to the unpacked folder to the Windows PYTHONPATH environment variable.

Now that you have installed Leo and told Python where to find Leo,
you are ready to `run Leo`_.

**Note**:
If you haven't already created a HOME environment variable, it would be good to
define home to be "%USERPROFILE%\My Documents".  You can check whether HOME exists
by typing 'echo %HOME%' (without the quotes) in a console window.

How to associate Leo with .leo files on Windows
***********************************************

Leo will open .leo files automatically provided that you associate leo.py with .leo files.
Here is how to open Leo when double-clicking a .leo file on Windows 2K or XP:

-   In Windows 2K or XP, go to ``Start->Settings->Control panel``, open the ``Folder Options`` tab.
-   Select the ``file types`` tab. Press the ``New`` button.
-   Enter ``Leo`` into the ``Create New File Extension`` field. Press OK.
-   With ``Leo`` still highlighted in the ``Registered File Types`` list box, press the ``Advanced`` button.
-   Change the default file type field to something like ``Leo Literate Outline``.
-   Press the ``Icon`` button and browse to the ``LeoDoc`` icon in Leo's ``Icons`` folder.
-   Click OK. This gets the icons right and registers the description of the .leo file.

You now have to tell windows what to do to open the file properly:

-   Press the new button to open the ``New Action`` window.
-   In the ``Action`` field type ``Open``, then type **one** of the following lines::

    <python install dir>\pythonw.exe   <path-to-unpacked-folder>\launchLeo.py "%1"
    <python install dir>\python.exe -i <path-to-unpacked-folder>\launchLeo.py "%1"
    
**Important**: <path-to-unpacked-folder> refers to the full path to the directory with a name like Leo-x-y,
where x and y are version numbers.
This unpacked folder must contain a folder called 'leo'.

**Important**: The -i option is not valid when using pythonw.exe.
Any call to pythonw -i will cause pythonw.exe to exit immediately.

The first  line opens Leo files with no console window.
The second line opens Leo files with a console window and leaves the window open after Leo exits.
You should now be able to double click on a leo file in explorer with Leo.

Installing Leo on MacOS X
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

By Randall Voth:
Leo works reliably only on MacOS X 10.3 (Panther) and above.
To run Leo on Macintosh OS X 10:

1.  Download and install ``MacPython 2.3 for Panther addons``.
    Python is already included in OS X 10.3 so only the addons are necessary at
    http://www.cwi.nl/~jack/macpython.html

2.  Download and install TclTkAqua from http://tcltkaqua.sourceforge.net/

3.  Run the PackageManager found in ``/Applications/MacPython-2.3`` and  
    install ``_tkinter-2.3-binary`` by clicking on the package in the list  
    and clicking the [Install:] button with ``Install dependencies`` checked.

4.  Download Leo (platform independent source.zip) from http://leo.sourceforge.net/

5.  Unzip the contents into a directory by double-clicking the downloaded file.
    Typically you would put the Leo folder into the ``Applications`` directory.

6.  Control-click on ``/path_to_unzipped_dir/leo/core/leo.py`` and open with ``PythonLauncher``.

7.  It is a good idea to set ``PythonLauncher`` as the default program to  
    open python scripts by clicking on ``leo.py``, choosing Get Info from the  
    Finder's File menu, and selecting "PythonLauncher" as the default  
    program to ``Open With:``
    By clicking the ``Change All...`` button, all python scripts will be  
    opened with ``PythonLauncher``.
    
8.  Download ``Pmw`` from http://pmw.sourceforge.net/
    ``Pmw`` must be installed in order to use the Settings panel.
    Drag the downloaded gzip file into
    ``/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.3/lib/python2.3/site-packages``
    Double click on it to unzip and untar the file into a folder to make it available to Python

How to use Platypus to create a Mac launcher for Leo
****************************************************

This documents how I used Platypus 3.0 to create MacLeo, the MacOS X launcher
for Leo. You don't need Platypus to _use_ MacLeo, but you do need Platypus to
*create* MacLeo. You may download Platypus 3.0 from http://sveinbjorn.vefsyn.is/platypus
Platypus creates something called an "application bundle," essentially a wrapper
for the shell script called openLeoScript.sh.

At present this script contains just::

    #!/bin/sh
    # $2 only works if .leo is one of the extensions.
    /usr/bin/pythonw ~/leo/core/leo.py $2

In detail, here is how I created MacLeo:

1.  Open Platypus.

2.  Set the Platypus settings::

	- Name: MacLeo
	- Script type: shell
	- Icon: Python Icon
		- Using the standard Leo outline doesn't work, but one could be createdâ€¦
	- Script Path: /Users/edream/dist/Platypus 3.0/openLeoScript.sh
	- Is droppable checkbox (checked)
		- Edit Types:  .leo only, not *, not folders.
		- N.B.  There MUST be a period in front of .leo!  Otherwise $2 will be empty in the script.
	- Output: None (progress bar and text window appear to be essentially useless)

3.  Hit the create button to create MacLeo.

How to create MacOS X .pkg files
********************************

This tells how I created ``leo-4-3-a3.pkg`` using ``PackageMaker``.

``PackageMaker`` is included in the ``Xtools`` disk that comes with MacOS X. Installing
``PackageMaker`` was easy, but I don't remember the details.

1.  Make sure ``~/dist/make-leo-dist`` contains a folder called ``leo-(version)``.
    The ``~/dist/make-leo-dist/leo-(version)`` folder should contain a *folder* called just ``leo``.
    This is the folder that should have the files to be distributed.
    I got this folder by downloading ``leo-4-3-a3.zip``, the official a3 distribution.

2.  Open ``PackageMaker`` by double-clicking the file ``~/dist/LeoPackage.pmsp``
    I originally created this .pmsp file in ``PackageMaker``.
    It will be included in the next official release.  I'll also add it to cvs.
    ``LeoPackage.pmsp`` contains most of the information needed to create the .pkg file,
    but even without the .pmsp file using ``PackageMaker`` is pretty self-explanatory

3.  Update the description in the ``PackageMaker`` dialog.
    This should be similar to the readme file.

4. Browse to ``~/dist/make-leo-dist/leo-(version)`` in the ``Files`` tab in the ``PackageMaker`` dialog.

5.  Choose ``Make Package`` from the ``PackageMaker File`` menu.
    If necessary, set the file name to ``Leo.pkg``.  This will create ``Leo.pkg``.

6.  Quit ``PackageMaker``.  Choose 'yes' when prompted to save ``LeoPackage.pmsp``.

Tracking the development version
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Many users will want to track the development version of Leo, in order to stay
on top of the latest features and bugfixes. Running the development version is
quite safe and easy, and it's also a requirement if you want to contribute to
Leo.

1. First, you need to get Bazaar (bzr) from http://bazaar-vcs.org. For windows
   users we recommend the standalone installer - the python installer may have
   problems pushing to Launchpad. Plain bzr installer only contains the command
   line version, so you might want to augment that with a friendly GUI - qbzr is
   recommended as it's the easiest one to install. It provides command like
   ``bzr qlog``, ``bzr qannotate`` etc.

2. Get Leo from launchpad by doing::

     bzr branch lp:leo-editor
     
And that's it! You can run leo/core/leo.py directly. When you want to refresh the
code with latest modifications from Launchpad, run ``bzr pull``.

If you make modifications to Leo (with the interest in sharing them with the Leo
community), you can check them in to your local branch by doing ``bzr checkin``.
Now, to actually request your changes to be merged to Leo trunk, you need a
Launchpad account with RSA keys in place. There is showmedo video about how to
accomplish this in Windows using puttygen and pageant at
``http://showmedo.com/videos/video?name=1510070&fromSeriesID=151``.

After your Launchpad account is set up, go to
``https://launchpad.net/leo-editor``, choose "Code" tab -> Register Branch,
select Branch type "Hosted" and fill in descriptive details about the branch.
After that, go to the branch home page from Code tab again, and copy-paste the
push command line to terminal. For example, for branch::

    https://code.launchpad.net/~leo-editor-team/leo-editor/mod_rclick
    
The push command is::

    bzr push bzr+ssh://my_name@bazaar.launchpad.net/~leo-editor-team/leo-editor/mod_rclick    

You may wish to add --remember command line option to bzr push, to direct all
future pushes to that location. Then, you only need to execute ``bzr push``.

After your branch is pushed, you can email the Leo mailing list and request it
to be reviewed and merged to trunk.

Running Leo
+++++++++++

You can run Leo from a Python interpreter as follows::

    import leo
    leo.run() # runs Leo, opening a new outline or,
    leo.run(fileName=aFileName) # runs Leo, opening the given file name.
    
Another way to run Leo is as follows::

    cd <path-to-launchLeo.py>
    python launchLeo.py %1

Here are some tips that may make running Leo easier:

**Linux**
    The following shell script will allow you to open foo.leo files by typing leo foo::
    
        #!/bin/sh 
        python <leopath>launchLeo.py $1
    
    where <leopath> is the path to the directory containing the leo directory. 

**Windows**
    If you have `associated .leo files with Leo`_ you may run Leo by double-clicking any .leo file.
    You can also use a batch file.
    Put the following .bat file in c:\\Windows::

        cd <path-to-leo>
        c:\python25\python <path-to-leo>launchLeo.py %1
        
    where <path-to-leo> is the path to the directory *containing* the leo directory.

    This opens the file specified by the first argument (%1).

The first time you start Leo, a dialog will ask you for a unique identifier. If
you are using cvs, use your cvs login name. Otherwise your initials will do. Leo
stores this identifier in the file ``.leoID.txt``. Leo attempts to create
``leoID.txt`` in the .leo sub-directory of your home directory, then in Leo's config directory, and
finally in Leo's core directory. You can change this identifier at any time by
editing ``.leoID.txt``.

Running Leo in batch mode
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

On startup, Leo looks for two arguments of the form::

    --script scriptFile

If found, Leo enters batch mode. In batch mode Leo does not show any windows.
Leo assumes the scriptFile contains a Python script and executes the contents of
that file using Leo's ``Execute Script`` command. By default, Leo sends all
output to the console window. Scripts in the scriptFile may disable or enable
this output by calling ``app.log.disable`` or ``app.log.enable``

Scripts in the scriptFile may execute any of Leo's commands except the ``Edit Body``
and ``Edit Headline`` commands. Those commands require interaction with the user.
For example, the following batch script reads a Leo file and prints all the
headlines in that file::

    path = r"<path-to-folder-containing-the-leo-folder>\leo\test\test.leo"
   
    g.app.log.disable() # disable reading messages while opening the file
    flag,newFrame = g.openWithFileName(path,None)
    g.app.log.enable() # re-enable the log.
    
    for p in newFrame.c.allNodes_iter():
        g.es(g.toEncodedString(p.h,"utf-8"))


How to install the Aspell spell checker
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You must install the Aspell package if you want to use Leo's Spell tab.

1.  Download and install the Aspell package from http://aspell.sourceforge.net/
    Typically this will create a directory called Aspell/bin

2.  If you are using Python 2.3 or Python 2.4 you must copy a dll
    from Leo's extensions folder to the Aspell/bin directory.
    This step is *not* needed if you are using Python 2.5 or later.
    Leo's extensions folder comes with two dll's: aspell23.pyd and aspell24.pyd,
    for Python 2.3 and 2.4 respectively.
    Make a copy of the appropriate dll, **rename it** to be aspell.pyd,
    and copy the renamed aspell.pyd file to Aspell/bin.

3.  Specify the location of the Aspell and Aspell/bin directories using
    the aspell_dir and aspell_bin_dir settings in LeoSettings.leo.
