If False, add_node_marker and http_support_main  do nothing.  Otherwise add_node_marker does the following:

1. add_node_marker writes a string using generate_node_marker.

Generates 'http-node-marker-'+str(number), where number is config.node_counter
(incremented each time add_node_marker is called.

2. Enables the following code in :

<t tx="ekr.20050903074833">Plugins and other scripts can register event handlers (also known as hooks) with code such as::

    leoPlugins.registerHandler("after-create-leo-frame",onCreate)
    leoPlugins.registerHandler("idle", on_idle) 
    leoPlugins.registerHandler(("start2","open2","command2"), create_open_with_menu) 

As shown above, a plugin may register one or more event handlers with a single call to
leoPlugins.registerHandler. Once a hook is registered, Leo will call the
registered function' at the named **hook time**. For example::

    leoPlugins.registerHandler("idle", on_idle)

causes Leo to call on_idle at "idle" time.

Event handlers must have the following signature::

    def myHook (tag, keywords):
        whatever

-   tag is the name of the hook (a string).
-   keywords is a Python dictionary containing additional information.
    The following section describes the contents of the keywords dictionary in detail.

**Important**: hooks should get the proper commander this way::

    c = keywords.get('c')
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050903074833.1">The following table tells about each event handler: its name, when it is called,
and the additional arguments passed to the hook in the keywords dictionary.
For some kind of hooks, Leo will skip its own normal processing if the hook
returns anything *other* than None. The table indicates such hooks with 'yes' in
the 'Stop?' column.

**Important**: Ever since Leo 4.2, the v, old_v and new_v keys in
the keyword dictionary contain *positions*, not vnodes. These keys are
deprecated. The new_c key is also deprecated. Plugins should use the c key instead.

============================= ======== =================================== =============================

**Notes**:

1.  'activate' and 'deactivate' hooks have been removed because they do not work as expected.

2.  'commands' hooks: The label entry in the keywords dict contains the
    'canonicalized' form of the command, that is, the lowercase name of the command
    with all non-alphabetic characters removed.
    Commands hooks now set the label for undo and redo commands 'undo' and 'redo'
    rather than 'cantundo' and 'cantredo'.

3.  'menu1' hook: Setting g.app.realMenuNameDict in this hook is an easy way of
    translating menu names to other languages. **Note**: the 'new' names created this
    way affect only the actual spelling of the menu items, they do *not* affect how
    you specify shortcuts settings, nor do they affect the 'official'
    command names passed in g.app.commandName. For example::

        app().realMenuNameDict['Open...'] = 'Ouvre'.

4.  'open1' and 'open2' hooks: These are called with a keywords dict containing the following entries:

    - c:          The commander of the newly opened window.
    - old_c:      The commander of the previously open window.
    - new_c:      (deprecated: use 'c' instead) The commander of the newly opened window.
    - fileName:   The name of the file being opened.

    You can use old_c.p and c.p to get the current position in the old and new windows.
    Leo calls the 'open1' and 'open2' hooks only if the file is not already open. Leo
    will also call the 'open1' and 'open2' hooks if: a) a file is opened using the
    Recent Files menu and b) the file is not already open.

5.  '\@url1' and '\@url2' hooks are only executed if the 'icondclick1' hook returns None.

6.  These hooks are useful for testing.

7.  These hooks allow plugins to parse and handle markup within doc parts,
    comments and Python ''' strings. Note that these hooks are *not* called in
    Python ''' strings. See the color_markup plugin for a complete example of how to
    use these hooks.

8.  Leo calls the 'create-optional-menus' hook when creating menus. This hook need
    only create new menus in the correct order, without worrying about the placement
    of the menus in the menu bar. See the plugins_menu and scripts_menu plugins for
    examples of how to use this hook.

9.  The New command calls 'new'.
    The 'new_c' key is deprecated.  Use the 'c' key instead.

10. g.scanDirectives calls 'scan-directives' hook.
    g.scanDirectives returns a dictionary, say d.
    d.get('pluginsList') is an a list of tuples (d,v,s,k) where:

    - d is the spelling of the @directive, without the leading @.
    - v is the vnode containing the directive, _not_ the original vnode.
    - s[k:] is a string containing whatever follows the @directive.
      k has already been moved past any whitespace that follows the @directive.

    See the add_directives plugins directive for a complete example of how to use
    the 'scan-directives' hook.

11. g.app.closeLeoWindow calls the 'close-frame' hook just before
    removing the window from g.app.windowList. The hook code may remove the window
    from app.windowList to prevent g.app.closeLeoWindow from destroying the window.

12. Leo calls the 'headkey1' and 'headkey2' when the headline *might* have changed.

13. p is the new node (position) containing '@auto filename.ext'

14. New in Leo 4.10: the d argument to the open-with event handlers is a python
    dictionary whose keys are all the tags specified by the user in the body of the
    @open-with node.

Formerly, this had to be on because the expansion bits
of @screenshot trees were significant.

Happily, this is no longer true.

True (recommended):
    Write "E" attribute bits in &lt;v&gt; elements.
    Leo outlines will record the expansion state of all nodes.

False:
    (Good for files like unitTest.leo)
    Suppress "E" attribute bits in &lt;v&gt; elements.
    Only the ancestors of the presently selected node will
    be expanded when Leo opens an outline.

The children of this node contain two @button scripts. These are disabled, but
you can execute them by selecting them and hitting Ctrl-B (execute-script).

To generate these docs by hand:

    - From this file, run rst3 on desired tree.
    - cd leo\doc\html
    - make html

To create pdf (probably easiest on Linux, with necessary latex packages installed):

    - make latex
    - cd _build/latex
    - make all-pdf
    
Important files:

- doc\html\conf.py contains settings, including the name of the master toctree
  document, leo_toc.html.txt.

- leo_toc.html.txt contains a list of all file to be included.

Leo 4.10 final                                         March 29, 2012

Leo 4.10 final is now available at: http://sourceforge.net/projects/leo/files/Leo/4.10%20final/

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more.
See http://leoeditor.com/intro.html

Leo 4.10 contains 9 months of intense work on Leo. Several very important
features are subtle; you could almost call them Easter Eggs, so please read
the following notes carefully.

The highlights of Leo 4.10:
--------------------------

* Dozens of new and improved features and commands, including...
  - Tab completion now shows all @command &amp; @button nodes.
  - Leo tabs may be detached from the main window.
  - The Open With menu now works.
  - The leoInspect module answers questions about Python code.
  - Leo can highlight the pane containing the focus.
  - The bigdash plugin searches across multiple files.
  - Improved abbreviation capabilities.
  - Improved handling of URL's.
  - Improved editing of non-Leo files.
  - Improvements create "weightless" unit testing.
  - Improved Leo's home page.
* Easier installation on MacOS.
* Fixed almost 70 bugs.

The Easter Eggs
---------------

1. Tab completion now shows all @command &amp; @button nodes.

Put all your common scripts in @command nodes in myLeoSettings.leo.
Typing &lt;Alt-X&gt;@c&lt;Tab&gt; will remind you of the names of these scripts.
You can execute the scripts by name without the "@command-" prefix.

2. Improved abbreviation capabilities.

Virtually any kind of abbreviation is possible. For example, ~a to ã.

3. Improved handling of URL's.

URL's can be used as links to other Leo outlines.

4 Weightless unit testing.

The mantra is edit, alt-4 (run-marked-unit-tests-externally), edit,
alt-4,... Several seemingly innocuous changes made this work without
"friction". The result is a remarkable increase in productivity.

    cget
    event_generate      g.app.gui.event_generate does exist.

<t tx="ekr.20120229094652.14525">leoQTextEditWidget overrides base toPythonIndex toPythonIndexRowCol.

The versions that call g.toPythonIndex are much slower than
leoQTextEditWidget.toPythonIndex.

The following classes have a toPythonIndex method:

leoQTextEditWidget (fast)

HighLevelInterface: calls g.toPythonIndex.
baseTextWidget: calls g.toPythonIndex.
leoFind: calls g.toPytonIndex.
leoQtBaseTextWidget: calls g.toPythonIndex.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20120229094652.14526">This is an important addition to reliability.

It ensures that body/log.widget and body.bodyCtrl/log.logCtrl are always in synch.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20120229094652.14527">Added eventFilter in createFrame in SDI/TabbedFrameFactory classes
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20120229094652.14528"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20120229094652.14532">All top-level code in leoTest.py now resides in the
TestManager class.

The c.testManager object eliminates the need for imports of
leo.core.leoTest within unitTest.leo, an excellent
simplification.

Furthermore, there is no need to access the testUtils class:
everything is in c.testManager.

The TestManager class substantially clarifies *all* the code
in leoTest.leo. This is surprisingly important because the
testing code is hardly straightforward.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20120229094652.14533">This is a major restructuring of Leo's code:
    
Initing settings files and local files is now as simple as possible.

g.openWithFileName now simply calls lm.loadLocalFile.

Commands.__init__ now calls c.finshCreate.

g.app.newCommander now simply calls Commands.__init__,
a *huge* collapse in complexity.

===== Details

The g.app.config class is now substantially simpler:
complex methods have moved to the LoadManager.

The new LoadManager class handles all aspects of Leo's
complex startup process, including most importantly the very
complex process by which Leo reads user settings.

As a side effect, c.config.get is now *much* simpler than
before: it search one, and *only* one dictionary to discover
settings.

Reading local files must be done *twice*. The first read
discovers settings, the second read uses those settings to
open the file. The first read always uses a null gui; the
second read uses g.app.gui, whatever that happens to be.

LM.openLocalFile embodies all aspects of the complex
strategy necessary for opening a local file twice. The first
read creates a PreviousSetting object, which is then passed
to LM.openFileByName, which in turn passes the
PreviousSetting object to the ctor for the Commander.
Finally, the PreviousSetting object inits c.config.

Because of the previousSettings object, the call to
LM.openFileByName does *not* need to "synthesize" a link to
c1 using c.hash. This stamps out bug 568452 at its source.

The crucial point is the previous settings get passed along
to the Commander ctor, *before* LM.openFileByName calls
c.fileCommands.openLeoFile to create the outline.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20120229094652.14534">- Moved findSettingsPosition to LocalConfigManager.

- Moved printSettings to LocalConfigManager.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20120229094652.14535"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20120229094652.14538">It's important to use only one version of the code.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20120229094652.14540"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20120229094652.14541">This allows the following pattern to appear in Leo source files::

    class myClass:
        @others
        
    if g.app.testing:
        myClass(c).test()
        
This is better than enabling the test with "if 1:" because c is not defined
while importing the module, so the import will fail if I forget to change
"if 1:" to "if 0" when saving the .leo file.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20120229094652.14542"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20120229094652.14543">- Generates only @auto, does not do an actual import.

- Creates @path nodes so actual @auto nodes are short.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20120229094652.14544">Added class CPrettyPrinter &amp; beatifyCCode
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20120229094652.14545">This command is a rewrapping of the first Python script I ever wrote. It
takes much of the scut work away from the task of converting C code to
Python code.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20120229094652.14567"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20120229094652.14576">The change was to DynamicWindow.createLogPane.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20120229094652.14577">This was Tk code, and so can not possibly be useful now.

Also removed the settings specific to the Tk colorizer.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20120229094652.14578">This important new method allows scripts to traverse an outline, deleting nodes
during the traversal. The pattern is::

    p = c.rootPosition()
    while p:
    if &lt;delete p?&gt;:
        next = p.positionAfterDeletedTree()
        p.doDelete()
        p = next
    else:
        p.moveToThreadNext()
        
This method also allows scripts to *move* nodes during a traversal, **provided**
that nodes are moved to a "safe" spot so that moving a node does not change the
position of any other nodes.

For example, the move-marked-nodes command first creates a **move node**, called
'Clones of marked nodes'. All moved nodes become children of this node.
**Inserting** these nodes as children of the "move node" does not change the
positions of other nodes. **Deleting** these nodes *may* change the position of
nodes, but the pattern above handles this complication cleanly.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20120229094652.14581">Leo creates @file nodes (not @thin nodes) when opening an external file.

Changed g.openWrapperLeoFile to create @file instead of @edit when possible.

Open now shows all files. This is a cue that *any* file may be opened:
non-Leo files are opened in @edit nodes.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20120229094652.14582"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20120229094652.14583">Rewrote the shellCommand, shellCommandOnRegion and executeSubprocess methods.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20120229094652.14584"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20120229094652.14585">Leo can act like a drop-in replacement for SciTe. Suppose you do::
    
    leo x.y
    
where y is not "leo". Leo now opens an unnamed .leo file consisting of
@edit x.y. if x.y exists, the @edit node contains the entire file;
otherwise the node is empty.

When you save the .leo files or close the Leo window Leo saves x.y if it
has been changed, but Leo does *not* prompt you to save the "temporary"
.leo file.

<t tx="ekr.20120229094652.14589">Updating Sphinx and using new .js files did the trick.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20120229094652.14590"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20120229094652.14592">The mod_scripting plugin so that the name of the command created by an @button
nodes does not include any [&lt;tag&gt;] that immediately follows @button. Examples::

    @button [ekr] x
    @button [edit] y
    @button [important] z

These buttons create commands named x, y and z, and the name of the buttons are
x, y and z.

Note that the '[' must be the first non-blank after @button to be recognized and
removed.

The code is a straightforward addition to cleanButtonText in mod_scripting.py:
it is unlikely to have any impact whatsoever to existing @button nodes.

The intended use is for searches of the form @button [some tag].
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20120229094652.14593">Wouldn't it be great if we all could remember what we, and others, have
already done? Now there is an easy way to do so: just put your
commonly-used scripts in global @command nodes. You do this by placing each
@command node as a child of an @commands node in your @settings tree in
myLeoSettings.leo.

Leo's tab completion now shows you all @command nodes, all @button nodes
and all the commands associated with those nodes.  To see the list of
all your @command nodes, simply type::

    &lt;Alt-X&gt;@c&lt;Tab&gt;
    
When I do that, I see::

    @command-print-cmd-docstrings
    @command-promote-bodies
    @command-remove-newlines
    @command-split-defs
    
For each @command (and @button node) Leo creates the correspond commands
without the leading "@command-", so you can use typing completion on the
shorter command name. For example, when writing documentation, I often use
the promote-bodies script. After the reminder above, I can execute the
script with::

    &lt;Alt-X&gt;prom&lt;Tab&gt;-&lt;Tab&gt;&lt;Return&gt;
    
Of course, to rexecute the command later, I can use repeat-complex-command
(Ctrl-P).

Summary
=======

If you put all your commonly-used scripts in @command nodes, you can use
&lt;Alt-X&gt;@c&lt;Tab&gt; to remind yourself of their names. That is, Leo's typing
completion eliminates the need for memory-intensive retrieval. I'm not
likely ever to forget typing completion.

This scheme takes full advantage of Leo's organization strengths and
*concentrates* those strengths by putting all the to-be-organized material
in one place. This allows for easy reorganization: changing command-name
prefixes, for instance, would be straightforward.

http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/dbd63b9b38911906

The problem isn't single/double, but double click not stopping the
event processing.  It has the correct form:

if g.doHook('doubleClick1') is None:
   do-normal-double-click-stuff
g.doHook('doubleClick2')

but I think some other route through the code, or additional processing
of the event means that even thought the handler registered on
doubleClick1 returns non-None, the node goes into headline edit mode,
with focus.

This is bad, because the doubleClick1 on an @url node attempts to
select and raise a different commander (tab), so now you're looking at
one commander but focus is in another, so what you type trashes the
headline in the original commander.

The timer shouldn't be needed - a 'doubleClick1' hook which returns
non-None should stop the headline going into edit mode.  If you can
make that be the case, all is well.

In detail:

2. g.getPythonEncodingFromString now can deal with either of the following lines:

    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

That is, g.getPythonEncodingFromString can strip the leading @first.

Having set undo to word granularity, I often change something, move to a
different line and continue editing there. When I want to undo my last change,
Leo also undoes the change in the other place, as word granularity currently
only recognizes a new undo step when a new word is started, no matter if we
moved to a completely different position first.

The attached patch fixes the issue by remembering the previous cursor position.

Something else about the undo code:

- oldSel and newSel are never set to None in the constructor -&gt; it's quite hard
  to know they are there without reading the whole code

- It would be cool if there could be some more comments in that section; e.g. to
  tell that oldSel and newSel from which old_row, old_col, new_row and new_col
  actually mean: old = "the position right before doing the change" and new =
  "the position right after doing the change" and that old != "the position
  after the change before" (which I added as prevSel) - it took me ages to
  discover this

- There are duplicate "The new and old characters are not contiguous." checks.
  Are they different/necessary?

- The "We have just inserted a line." section is not only entered on a new line
  (see other attached patch)

<t tx="ekr.20120229094652.14787">Code that wants to set a particular part of a widget's style sheet calls::

   g.app.gui.update_style_sheet(w,key,value)

where w is the widget whose stylesheet is to be changed, key is unique
to the method (or group of methods), and value is the new version of
the stylesheet **for the particular key** to be added.  Examples::

   # In setEditorColors.
   sheet = 'background-color: %s; color: %s' % (bg,fg)
   g.app.gui.update_style_sheet(obj,'colors',sheet)

   # In add_border.
   sheet = "border: %spx solid %s" % (
       c.focus_border_width,c.focus_border_color)

   # In remove_border.
   sheet = "border: %spx solid white" % (c.focus_border_width)
   self.update_style_sheet(w,'border',sheet)

So add_border and remove_border work together because they use the
same 'border' key.

g.app.gui.update_style_sheet is straightforward: it injects a Python
dict called leo_stylesheet_dict into the widget, and computes the
total stylesheet as follows::

   # Step one: update the dict.
   d = hasattr(w,'leo_styles_dict') and w.leo_styles_dict or {}
   d[key] = value
   w.leo_styles_dict = d

   # Step two: update the stylesheet.

- Ignore case of html/xml tags.

Rev 4774.1.1:

Fixed all known html-import problems in a clean way. Unit tests exists, but they
use external files. They will be converted soon.

Important changes:

1. Added hasNestedClasses ivar in the baseScannerClass, True only for xml/html scanners.

When True, scanHelper and skipDecls allocate a substring to be used for all further scanning.
This is the *only* way to limit Leo's scanners properly.

This was, in essence, the fix for duplicate code generation arising from unbalanced tags:
skipToEndOfTag and skipToMatchingTag can't match outside the present tag because
the 's' argument passed to those methods has already been truncated.

This is a simple, elegant solution, and in essence the *only* proper solution.
For example, it would not work to past an 'end' argument to skipToEndOfTag and skipToMatchingTag
because the scanners inside those methods do not understand an 'end' argument.

Thus, the simplest, most efficient solution is for scanHelper and skipDecls to truncate the
string to be scanned. That way, the truncation happens at most once per "class".

2. Added hasDecls in the baseScannerClass, False only for xml/html scanners.

Various methods call skipDecls only if this ivar is True.

Rev 4773:

Fixed recent botch: both single and double quotes are allowed in html. 

Rev 4772:

When we clone a node inside an @shadow (containing @others) node and then
refresh the @shadow node from file, the clone is unlinked and marked as changed.
If we now save, close the .leo file and open it again, the nodes are linked
again! (showing "cloned" symbol) User's thought: "How the heck can the file
change _between save and re-open_ when I changed nothing?"

I think what should be done about this is the check that Leo does when it opens
the file again, and that check should be done immediately after the "refresh
node from file" operation. Also, at this point, the "Recovered nodes" node
should appear (if file and node have both changed), not only after the next .leo
file close/reopen (as that happens quite infrequently, I guess, e.g. once a day
for me). Otherwise, the user can easily lose data.

Steps to reproduce:

- Create a node "@edit ~/aaa.txt" assuming aaa.txt does not exist
- Ctrl-S save outline, log reports creating ~/aaa.txt
- Edit text in body
- Ctrl-S save outline, pop-up pops-up erroneously.

The problem was that replaceTargetFileIfDifferent should set root.v.at_read.
Now it does.

Note: both replaceFileWithString methods are part of the @shadow logic,
so there is no need to set any at_read bit in those methods.

I loaded an outline with @auto nodes pointing to an out of date path. So body
texts were empty. I updated the paths in the node headlines and saved the file,
expecting to be prompted for overwriting the existing files (now the paths were
correct again), but they were over-written with the blank content without
warning. Damn.

Steps to reproduce in a simpler way below, but don't write the
below of as contrived, because the above is the real problem.

Create @auto /home/tbrown/text.txt

enter text, save file

Edit headline to @auto /home/tbrown/Desktop/text.txt

enter text, save file

Edit headline back to /home/tbrown/text.txt

-----

I now see this happens also if the path change is in a @path node ancestor of the @auto node.

This anomaly only occurs when all of the following conditions are true:

1) There is a global command name X that is the "same" as the root name of the
file containing a plugin Y. Here, "same" means equal after the command name is
converted to lower case and all underlines in the root name are replaced by
dashes.

2) A shortcut (a.k.a. keystroke) is bound to command name X.

When these conditions are true, then the Plugins dropdown menu shows the key
binding next to the plugin name and left-clicking the plugin name executes the
global command--and, there is no way to display the plugin's help.

I've added web page bookmarking from your browser to Leo.

Docs., appended to the mod_http plugin, where this functionality lives,
are pasted below.

Screen shot of the form which pops up when you click the Bookmark
button in your browser attached.  The body text of the corresponding
bookmark node created in Leo is:

    Leo's Home Page
        http://leoeditor.com

        Tags: leo, python

        Leo's Home Page

        Collected: Sun 02 Oct 2011 02:52:51 PM CDT

        Keep this under your pillow.

If you had some text selected on the page in your browser that would
also appear in the above, and repeatedly bookmarking the same page with
different selections incrementally adds such quotes to the bookmark
node.

Here are the docs.:

Can also be used for bookmarking directly from the browser to Leo.  To
do this, add a bookmark to the browser with the following URL / Location:

    javascript:w=window;if(w.content){w=w.content}; d=w.document; w.open('http://localhost:8130/_/add/bkmk/?&amp;name=' + escape(d.title) + '&amp;selection=' + escape(window.getSelection()) + '&amp;url=' + escape(w.location.href),%22_blank%22,%22toolbar=no, location=no, directories=no, status=no, menubar=no, scrollbars=no, resizable=yes, copyhistory=no, width=800, height=300, status=no%22);void(0)

and edit the port (8130 in the example above) to match the port you're using
for mod_http.

Bookmarks are created as the first node in the outline which has been opened longest.
You can set the ``@string`` ``http_bookmark_unl`` to specify an alternative location,
e.g.::

    @string http_bookmark_unl = /home/tbrown/.bookmarks.leo#@bookmarks--&gt;Incoming

to place them in the `Incoming` node in the `@bookmarks` node in the `.bookmarks.leo` outline.

The headline is preceeded with '@url ' *unless* the ``bookmarks`` plugin is loaded.
If the ``bookmarks`` plugin is loaded the bookmark will have to be moved to a ``@bookmarks`` tree to be useful.

The browser may or may not be able to close the bookmark form window for you, depending on settings - set ``dom.allow_scripts_to_close_windows`` to true
in ``about:config`` in Firefox.

completely eliminate the overhead in running unit tests:

    - The run-marked-unit-tests-externally (Alt-4) command runs all marked
      @test nodes. To choose tests, just mark them.
    - Alt-4 now saves the .leo file first.
    - Almost all unit tests may now be run externally:
        - External unit tests always read config settings.
        - The nullGui now uses a fully capable string-based body widget.
        - The nullGui now uses the regular undoer.
    - Unit tests now always have the sources available.
    - Disabled messages on external unit tests.
    - The unit test commands always run a selected @test node.

These improvements mean that almost all unit tests may be run externally.
In turn, this creates a remarkable work flow::

    Edit
    Alt-4
    Edit
    Alt-4
    ...

The energy difference between weightless and heavy is astounding. Try the
new way: you will surely like it.

**Notes**:

Experience shows that being able to run the desired unit tests *without*
selecting any particular node makes an amazingly large difference. Being
able to run all and only marked unit tests is a big step forward.

If a marked node is neither an @test node nor an @suite node, all nodes in
the tree are considered to be marked.

For almost 15 years Leo has been written using a limited set of classes.
These were "big" classes, implementing major modules of Leo. There is
nothing wrong with these classes, and they will remain unchanged, except
insofar as they will be simplified by the classes I am about to discuss.

Recently, I have become aware that Leo's code could be considerably
simplified by adding "smallish" classes. Indeed, I now think the
distinction between big and small classes is unhelpful. The most important
part of the design of a class is simply whether a class implements an
understandable concept.

With this introduction, here is a short summary of Leo's new classes. Some
have not been fully implemented. Getting them all to work is a big part of
the rewrite of Leo's config, loading and key-handling code.

Ref 4952 of the trunk fixes bug 87933:
"Redefining a key binding breaks menu items with same binding"

This was a difficult bug to fix--I rewrote significant parts of Leo's
code that deals with settings for key binding.

Besides fixing the bug, Leo computes accelerators in menu items
dynamically when the user activates a menu.  The accelerator shows
*all* keys bound to the command associated with the menu item.

From the checkin log:

A major reorganization of the configuration code that fixes bug 87933
Redefining a key binding breaks menu items with same binding

- Replaced g.bunches with ShortcutInfo objects...

- Wrote and tested make_settings_dict and its helpers,
  merge_settings_dicts, invert and uninvert.

- Leo computes menu texts dynamically in onAboutToShow.

- leo_update_shortcut now shows all shortcuts for a command.

- leoMenu.define_enable_dict encapsulates data used to enable/disable
  commands regardless of where those commands appear in Leo's menu. The old
  code assumed that a fixed menu location for all commands that could be
  enabled or disabled.</t>

The right-click context menu on the tabs in the tabbed window mode (the
default) has a 'Detach' option, if there's more than one outline/tab, and a
Re-attach all option, if there's a detached outline window out there.

Now there's also 'Horizontal tile', and 'Vertical tile', which detach the
tab and then tile its window with the window from which it was detached.

This is very helpful for moving nodes between outlines, I was rearranging
the windows by hand and setting one to 'always on top' with the window
manager before. Note: there's a @setting to determine whether dragging
nodes between outlines copies or moves them.

Depending on your OS / window manager, tiling / placement may be somewhat
off, and may work better with or without the window being maximized before
tiling, you'll have to experiment.

When you close an outline window created by detaching a tab the outline is
just re-attached as a tab. This means it's now possible to reattach just
one outline, rather than having to use the 'reattach all' option.

However, there does not seem to be any fix:

All works well on Windows 7.  I do see the "system-wide" model
behavior on Ubuntu.

This appears to be a Ubuntu-specific bug.  Indeed, the popup is a
QListWidget.  Such widgets have a setWindowModality method::

    setWindowModality ( Qt::WindowModality windowModality )

The valid modalities are at: http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7-snapshot/qt.html#WindowModality-enum

NonModal: The window is not modal and does not block input to other
windows.

WindowModal: The window is modal to a single window hierarchy and
blocks input to its parent window, all grandparent windows, and all
siblings of its parent and grandparent windows.

ApplicationModal: The window is modal to the application and blocks
input to all windows.

None of these would appear to be a system-wide modality, and
furthermore, the default is supposed to be NonModal.

Anyway, calling setWindowModality(QtCore.Qt.NonModal) does not seem to
have much effect on Ubuntu, so I think I can safely say there is
nothing more I can do.

Ever find that you have a whole lot of:

.. sourcecode:: py

  rec[f['analyte']] ... rec[f['sample_type']] ...

expressions in your code, and now things have changed and you want them
all to be:

.. sourcecode:: py

  row.Analyte ... row.Sample_Type ...

basically if str variable s was::

  rec[f['analyte']]

then you want to perform:

.. sourcecode:: py

  s = "row."+s.split("'")[1].title()

on each one.  In general it would be nice to be able to use a python
expression when search and replace doesn't cut it.

The button code below creates a button, ``fac``, which, when pressed,
creates another button, with some name you choose, which, when pressed,
executes some python code to fix the selected text in the body.

You can define the code to be executed in two ways, either in its own
node:

 - insert a new node with a headline which describes the refactor
 - enter code in the node which modifies the string variable ``s``,
   which is initially set to the selected text in the body
 - press the ``fac`` button, which creates a new button named
   after this code node
 - select each offending piece of text and press the button created
   in the previous step to fix

or

 - type some code modifying ``s`` right in the body you're working on
 - press the ``fac`` button, which creates a new button named "fix"
 - select each offending piece of text and press the button created
   in the previous step to fix

Note:

 - unlike regular button nodes, changing the code after the
   button's created (first option above) doesn't change the code
   executed by the button
 - replacing selection text makes Leo reposition the insert point at
   the top of the window, this is annoying but unrelated to this code

Here's the button code:

.. sourcecode:: py

  @button fac
    from leo.plugins.mod_scripting import scriptingController

    sc = scriptingController(c)

    if c.frame.body.hasSelection():
        code = c.frame.body.getSelectedText()

<t tx="ekr.20120313074006.14640">Leo's abbreviation code is now simpler and more general than before. The
downside is that you will likely have to revise your abbreviations. I
believe the extra work will be well worthwhile.

Here are the changes:

1. Abbreviations may consist of *any* sequence of characters, including
whitespace or "special" characters. You may include whitespace characters
in definitions using the '\t' and '\n' escapes. However, whitespace may
only appear at the *end* of definitions.

2. You must take care to disambiguate abbreviations if one is a prefix of
   another.

Here is an example of both points.  As always, you define
abbreviations in the body of an @global-abbreviation node or
@abbreviation node::

    nc =@nocolor\n
    nc\n=@nocolor\n
    nc\t=@nocolor\n

    ncn=@nocolor-node\n

As you can see, the definitions uses whitespace at the end
of the definition of "nc" to prevent it from being expanded
when typing "ncn".

3. The reason I call these abbreviations "instant" is that they can be
triggered on *any* keystroke, not just the end of a "word".  This
allows you to define::

    teh=the

Hurray!

4. Two rules limit scans.  They are useful and shouldn't cause
hardships.

A.  The backspace and delete characters *never* trigger substitutions.

B. The scan for definitions ends at the first newline
character. Therefore, whitespace will have effect only at
the *end* of a definition.

**Important**: these rules can cause problems when *defining*
abbreviations:  it's easy to trigger an unwanted definition.  The
solution is to use rule 4B:

I want to type::

    ncn=@nocolor-node\n

But I **cant** type this directly if nc is already defined!  The trick
is to type::

   nxcn=@nocolor-node\n

and then delete the leading x with a backspace character.

Of course, you could also turn abbrevions off while defining abbreviations...

Instant abbreviations solve the problems with Brazilian
keyboards. Just define::

    ~a=ã
    ~A=Ã
    etc.

This works regardless of keyboard, regardless of OS, etc.
You might want to define::

    ~\a=~a
    ~\A=~A

in the somewhat unlikely event that you want to type ~a rather than,
say, ~+a.  Of course, you don't need these, provided you remember to
type ~xa &lt;Right&gt;&lt;Delete&gt; :-)

Function expandNodeAndGoToFirstChild() is referenced only
once in LeoPyRef.leo. This reference is in table of public

The node in which expandNodeAndGoToFirstChild() is defined

should go to whichever tab becomes visible, but it does not,
it goes to an arbitrary tab which may not be visible. If you
then hit Alt-X expecting to cut the highlighted node in the

This class encapsulates almost all the code in runLeo.py, as well as some
methods in leoGlobals.py that really belong somewhere else.

Creating a class simplifies the code to a surprising degree: 5 or 6 ivars
of the class represent command-line options. These ivars are always
available: there is no need to pass them around as arguments.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20120318075211.6169">The ModeController class represents a collection of modes. The ModeInfo
class represents a single mode.

Without these classes, the code in leoKeys.py is extremely hard to
understand. In fact, the old code was a perfect example of the problems
with procedural programming: client code was burdened with knowing way too
many details about matters that it shouldn't have to know about.
Furthermore, that data itself is hard to understand: it's too "raw". These
classes provide "identity" for data. repr(aModeInfo) is surprisingly
useful.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20120318075211.6170">This class represents the global log.  It hides the details of the log
from the g.app class and several other pieces of code.

At present, the interface to this class is procedural.  That is, the
present g.app methods that will be moved into this class have a
procedural rather than descriptive nature.  I'm not sure how much this
will change, but creating this class may create opportunities that
were not apparently previously.

<t tx="ekr.20120318075211.6172">The KeyStroke class is a wrapper for plain strings. It's most important
attribute is its *identity*. It announces that its contents is a
canonicalized value, not a raw user settings string or any other kind of
data associated with key handling.

Similar remarks apply to ShortcutInfo objects. Their identity clarifies the
code. The former code used g.bunches. In complex code such as leoKeys.py,
such anonymous objects really obfuscate matters.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20120318075211.6173">This class solves a problem that has been annoying me ever since I created
leoEditCommands.py. The problem is this: without this class the classesList
has to be defined at the end of the module, after all classes have been
imported. Worse, several module-level methods were needed to manage the
classesList.

In the new scheme, each Commander creates an EditCommandsManager, and the
code that previously had to call the module-level method
leoEditCommands.x(c) now simply calls c.editCommandManager.x(). This is
much cleaner and avoids several very ugly imports. Which brings me to...
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20120318075211.6174">Now, most modules import only leo.core.leoGlobals. This simplifies Leo's
startup process considerably. This is something that I've wanted to do for
a long time. To make this work, it is *essential* that leoGlobals.py import
*no* other Leo modules.

However, Leo's core still imports leo.core.leoNodes in order to create
positions, vnodes, etc. It would be straightforward to eliminate these by
creating g.app factory methods, but there is no urgent reason to do so.

The ctor for the Commands class imports many modules. This is essential to
break what would otherwise be circular dependencies among Python imports.
We can extend this pattern by creating more classes, as was done with the
EditCommandsManager class.

Leo looks like relatively ordinary outline editor,
but it has unique scripting and data-organizing abilities.

Scripting
---------

- Any node in the outline may contain a Leo script.
- Leo can *compose* scripts from a node and its descendants.
- Leo scripts can *easily* access all the data in any outline.

Leo scripts can do things that can't be *imagined* in other editors.

Data-organizing
---------------

- Cloned nodes may appear many times in the same outline.
- Clones create views of data that persist indefinitely.
  Any set of nodes may appear in arbitrirly many views of the data.
- Headlines naturally describe the data contained in nodes.


Script nodes
------------

**Leo completely integrates scripting and outlines.** |br|
Leo outlines are true Python objects, not just text.

\1. **Headlines naturally define types**, such as:

**@file** trees create external files. |br|
**@test** nodes and trees create unit tests. |br|
**@button** nodes create **script buttons**. |br|
**@command** nodes create user-defined commands. |br|
**@html** trees create web pages. |br|
**@settings** trees contain Leo settings.

\2. **Any node may contain a Leo script**:

A simple outline-aware markup language creates scripts |br|
and external files from outline nodes and trees.

\3. **Leo scripts have *easy* access to all outline data**:

All Leo scripts execute with these **predefined symbols**: |br|
**c** gives access to all outline data and all of Leo's code. |br|
**p** is the presently selected node in the script. |br|
**p.h** is the headline text; **p.b** is the body text. |br|
**g** is a module containing utility functions &amp; classes.

\4. **All parts of Leo are scriptable**, including: |br|

.. In short, all outline data are completely scriptable.</t>

Apart from the full text search indexing script I just added, I've made
a bunch of basically cosmetic changes to Ville's multi outline full text
search tool.  There's a new @setting, @int fts_max_hits, which controls
the max hits returned, instead of the hardwired default of 30.

With any sensible value for fts_max_hits, searches for terms which
generate many hits in many outlines won't return the full list of
outlines containing hits, because the search stops when fts_max_hits is
reached.  I set fts_max_hits to a non-sensible 1200 to get around this,
it seems to work fine.  Obviously terms which generate that many hits
are bad search terms anyway, but it's helpful to get as close to the
full list of outlines containing hits as possible.

Also most of my changes apply only to the "f target" find command, not
the simpler "s target" search command.</t>

Can also be used for bookmarking directly from the browser to Leo.  To
do this, add a bookmark to the browser with the following URL / Location:

    javascript:w=window;if(w.content){w=w.content}; d=w.document; w.open('http://localhost:8130/_/add/bkmk/?&amp;name=' + escape(d.title) + '&amp;selection=' + escape(window.getSelection()) + '&amp;url=' + escape(w.location.href),%22_blank%22,%22toolbar=no, location=no, directories=no, status=no, menubar=no, scrollbars=no, resizable=yes, copyhistory=no, width=800, height=300, status=no%22);void(0)

and edit the port (8130 in the example above) to match the port you're using
for mod_http.

Bookmarks are created as the first node in the outline which has been opened longest.
You can set the ``@string`` ``http_bookmark_unl`` to specify an alternative location,
e.g.::

    @string http_bookmark_unl = /home/tbrown/.bookmarks.leo#@bookmarks--&gt;Incoming

to place them in the `Incoming` node in the `@bookmarks` node in the `.bookmarks.leo` outline.

The headline is preceeded with '@url ' *unless* the ``bookmarks`` plugin is loaded.
If the ``bookmarks`` plugin is loaded the bookmark will have to be moved to a ``@bookmarks`` tree to be useful.

The browser may or may not be able to close the bookmark form window for you, depending on settings - set ``dom.allow_scripts_to_close_windows`` to true
in ``about:config`` in Firefox.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20130526065545.14927">As of rev 5309 of the trunk, Leo now supports @auto-otl, along with
imports of .otl files.

**Warning**: the new code is simply a prototype.  Play with these
features *only* on files you can afford to be corrupted.

To use @auto-otl:

1.  The easy, and relatively safe way:

- Use Leo's import-file command to create and populate an @auto-otl
node.
- Save the .leo file.

2. The manual, less safe way:

- Create a node called @auto-otl x.y
  x can be an absolute path or a path relative to the directory
containing the .leo file.

- Save the .leo file, but **do not** overwrite the existing .otl file
when prompted.

Either way, you should now have an @auto-otl node whose **children**
represent the contents of the external .otl file.  (The actual @auto-
otl node is *not* written to the external file.  This allows you to
put Leo directives in the node.) Changing the children in Leo will
change the external file.  Changing the external file outside of Leo
will update the outline the next time you restart the .leo file
containing the @auto-otl node.

**Important**: as with all kinds of @auto nodes, clone links will
break the next time you load Leo if the @auto-otl tree contains any
kind of cloned nodes.  This is pretty much a fundamental limitation of
@auto trees.

However, if the VO people wanted to *retain* gnx's when editing in
vim, it would, in theory, be possible to retain clone links when Leo
read the external .otl file.  I don't plan to do this any time soon,
and it would require and extension to the VO file format, but I wanted
to point out the possibilities.


&gt; **Important**: as with all kinds of @auto nodes, clone links will
&gt; break the next time you load Leo if the @auto-otl tree contains any
&gt; kind of cloned nodes.  This is pretty much a fundamental limitation of
&gt; @auto trees.

I'd like to add two points to this discussion:

1. This limitation instantly disappears when you convert from (any
kind of) @auto to @file.  The reason is that the sentinels that Leo
writes "carry" both outline structure *and* node identity.  It is this
unique, immutable node identity which provides for robust linking of
clones.

I hinted in another thread that a smallish addition to the otl format
would allow .otl files to carry identity.  For example, suppose that
headlines were optionally represented in the file format as::

    &lt;indentation: hard tabs&gt; :: gnx :: headline

The VO folks could do this in an upward compatible manner without
changing vim's core in any way.  True, it doesn't give VO Leo's clone
capabilities, but it *retains* the information necessary to use clones
*in Leo*.

2. Unlike .otl, the external files produced by Leo can be used
*unchanged* as program source files.  Indeed, all of Leo's Python
source files contain outline structure and node identity--Leo
sentinels are simply comment lines in the appropriate language.  In
contrast, the format of .otl files ensures that body text can not be
used untranslated as source code.  It is the ability to *be* source
code, even more than cloning, that makes Leo's external file format so
useful.

&gt; As of rev 5309 of the trunk, Leo now supports @auto-otl, along with
&gt; imports of .otl files.

Rev 5310 contains a rewrite of the scanHelper method.  As before, this
code should be considered experimental.

The scanHelper method now parses each line of the .otl independently:
any combination of headline and body lines should now be valid,
regardless of indentation level.  If necessary, the parser will insert
intermediate nodes so as to allow lines that are indented more than
one more than the previous node. This is the most general scheme that
I can imagine.</t>

A new script, now in scripts.leo, cleans up imported @file nodes as follows:

- Moves a shebang line from the first child to the root.
- Moves a leading docstring in the first child to the root.
- Uses a section reference for declarations.
- Removes leading and trailing blank lines from all nodes.
- Merges a node containing nothing but comments with the next node.
- Merges a node containing no class or def lines with the previous node.

The Aha: dealing with trees *after* they have been created is much
easier than creating the tree in the first place.

It would be impossible to conceive of this script in any other environment.
Leo's node structure drastically simplifies the patterns to be discovered.

<t tx="ekr.20130526065545.14930">6/2/12

The recursive import script now contains a suite of post-processing fixes:

- Replacing backslashes with forward slashes in headlines.
- Removing empty nodes.
- Adding @path directives that reduce the needed path specifiers in descendant nodes.
- Adding @file to nodes or replacing @file with @@file.


No matter how good Leo's importers are, (and they are now quite good),
there will *always* be cases where thoughtful human intervention will be
required.

Some import mistakes can *only* be found by running tests.  For
complex programs like 2to3, the only truly safe way to check imports
is by running the 2to3 test suite.

Which leads me to my suggestion:

I read the find and replace instructions here:

And followed the &lt;Ctrl-shift-r&gt;find-pattern&lt;return&gt;replace-text&lt;return&gt;

two crucial steps: Ctrl+= &amp; F3

Ctrl+- combines the effect of Ctrl+= &amp; F3, so you typically only use
Ctrl+= when you know your on the last entry of interest and don't want

But you're right about the docs, something this basic should be clear.

Recently I evaluated docear - a mind-mapping tool for collecting reference
data (written in Java). It automatically extracts bookmarks and annotations
from PDF files, and more, but it's support for authoring is still not up to
the task. I think it would be great if Leo could do some of the tasks
docear is doing.

Leo is primarily a literate programming editor, but also quite good at
organizing bits of information. Dragging a PDF into Leo currently just
creates an url to the PDF. This could be expanded to also extract data
(bookmarks, notes) from the PDF and to sync this data between Leo and the
PDF. This info could be placed in child nodes: bookmarks and notes could
even jump directly to the page in the PDF (although each PDF viewer seems
to have a different syntax for doing that). This would be a great way to
organize data sheets and specifications stemming from external sources.

Combining the above with an improved LaTeX support, one would get a very
powerful research and authoring tool - in my opinion with a much more
convenient interface than docear.

Perhaps it is too much work to duplicate all the work docear is doing. An
alternative may be to sync data somehow between docear and Leo. Docear
stores the data in a freeplane mind-map. Has anyone else thoughts about
this? Offray Vladimir Luna Cárdenas offray@riseup.net via googlegroups.com

I have been using Leo to write my thesis. I didn't know about Docear, but
my use was in some sense similar. I have a lot of @url links pointint to
the pdfs files and in a subtree I cut and paste the text of the pdf I want
to comment and made the comments inside the tree. These pdf were part of my
bibliographic entries and I'm now writing a .bib file for these, so I can
have in only one Leo tree all my thesis, with all the references to
external files and the annotations and bibtex entries for them. For me the
key point of Leo in academic writing is the tree view plus the clones and
ignore nodes. My thesis can have several layers, the external ones being
the actual writing and the deeper ones the references, texts, images, tools
that enable me to do that writing. Using clones and @rst-no-head directives
I can have the level of granularity of a paragraph, something that is not
possible on traditional word processor which are the writing tool of tools
like docear. This approach have some glitches:

* I still need to do some fine tunning to the LaTeX export for writing the
pdf as I want. I imagine that putting sphinx in the tool chain could change
that.

* I can not get much people of my companions using this advangages, besides
of myself, because of the difficult installation process of Leo in
Windows/Mac and the not so friendly interface for non-programmers. Other
light markup structured text writing programs like Nested[1] are more
easily used and understood despite of not having all the advantages and
flexibility of Leo.

So, in resume, may be the better approach is connecting Leo to Docear, so
you can have the advantages of both in terms of easy multiplataform
installation and friendly interface of the later and programmability,
flexibility and deeper organic structure of the former.

I'm not really sure how notes get embedded in PDFs.  As an aside, there
is also capability for using Leo to manage bookmarks to web pages, with
notes, tags, and snippets.  Look at the mod_http plugin.  It uses a
javascript bookmark button in your browser to communicate with Leo.

&gt; Combining the above with an improved LaTeX support, one would get a very
&gt; powerful research and authoring tool - in my opinion with a much more

&gt; this?

Syncing between the two sounds a little cumbersome to me.  I wonder if
the PDF stuff could be integrated with some sort of BibTeX .bib file
management?

Do you really need the mindmap UI of docear?  I used to use Freemind
which has a very similar interface, but switched to Leo.  I like what
http://cmap.ihmc.us/ does, but it only does idea organization, no
authoring etc.  To me cmaptools is better at idea organizing than
mindmaps.

There is also the backlinks plugin for Leo, which allows arbitrary
networks of links instead of just the directed tree, and graphcanvas,
which allows graph layout of nodes.  There aren't comparable with the
mindmap layouts, but they head in that direction.  Also note Leo's
hidden UI flexibility in the context menus on the pane dividers, you
can open a new window for the graphcanvas plugin, which gives it much
needed screen real estate.

no, I do not need the mindmap stuff at all. I had a look at short look at
cmaptools, and I agree the generalized graph approach seems better than a
standard mindmap. But I am quite happy with the tree view in Leo and as you
already mentioned, this can be extended with backlinks etc. I have used Leo
already to organize reference documents and write documentation (using
Latex).

What I do want is links to a particular page of a PDF - links to just a
file are not enough when you refer to documents with 100+ pages.
Unfortunately this seems to be difficult to achieve in a cross-platform
way, particular when trying to support different PDF viewers. Docear is
solving this (and other compatibility problems) by developing its own
integrated viewer (I do not suggest to do this for Leo).

On second thought, I don't think that extracting the bookmark and
annotation info is really important to me - I would keep that info in the
PDF, anyhow. I would write inside Leo addional notes, and the output text
(in Latex).

Some integration of Bibtex may be a good thing and needs to be thought out
- perhaps by using JabRef for this, or by recycling some pyBibliographer
code, but this is also low on my priority list.

Offray seems to have a very similar use case as I - although I do not write
a thesis, but specifications for scientific instruments. The point about
cross-platform installation ease is also well taken, so I will look into
some inter-operability here (either with docear or cmaptools). I see Leo
mainly as a personal project / information manager: the leo tree is not
easily shared with others, while the files Leo points to with @url, @auto,
@file etc can be shared quite easily. In this I use Leo as *my personal*
view on the project.

Yes, I suppose one could translate from a canonical representation inside
Leo to whatever the tool needs (using @setting). Ideally, one would even
have a choice between opening the new page in a different or in the same
PDF viewer instance as the last page, but few viewers support that (Okular
does - but I don't know any cross-platform solution).

(Possibly uninteresting ramblings)

I'm currently doing some stuff with Angular.js which is using Jasmine for
test cases by default.

Jasmine is using interesting "friendly" terminology for unit testing
concepts.

setup is "beforeEach", teardown is "afterEach".

Test cases and suites are declared with "describe", and "it"; have to say
it looks great in coffeescript:

http://coffeescriptcookbook.com/chapters/testing/testing_with_jasmine

describe 'Calculator', -&gt; it 'can add two positive numbers', -&gt; calculator

As of rev 5650, Leo contains support for @testsetup nodes.  At present, I 
am pretty sure they work only when running unit tests locally.

In effect, @testsetup nodes provide common setup code for all following 
@test and @suite nodes.  Such common setup code is the real reason for 
having custom subclasses of unittest.TestCase.  This is a superb Leonine 
solution.  It is much than either

a) @testclass nodes (which I never use) or
b) "injecting" common test code using exec(g.findTestScript(c,'@common 
name-of-common-test-code'))

Leo's test-execution code prepends the body text of an @testsetup node to 
all following @test and @suite nodes.  Multiple @testsetup nodes may appear 
in an outline--the range of an @testsetup node extends over all following 
@test and @suite nodes until the next @testsetup node is seen (in outline 
order).  

This pattern is a direct result of the problems I have been having in the 
static type checking project.  The simplification of test code that has 
resulted is truly remarkable.  A single @testsetup node replaces &lt;&lt;setup&gt;&gt; 
sections that had to be present in every single test.  Hurray!

That's how I run Leo, (console is great for windows).  Unless you 
specifically call pythonw.exe it should use python.exe located through your 
"Path" system enbironment variable.  Here is what I use in the shell 
setting for a console "leo" tab:
    cmd.exe /k C:\\entPY27\\python.exe 
"C:\\VC\\Bzr\\leo-editor\\trunk\\launchLeo.py"
the cmd.exe /k portion creates a dos window that the rest of the command 
line is run in, (the dos window is hidden offscreen and console uses its 
magic to present it inside of its buffer.  This now serves as stdio, (and 
stderr) and catches messages written by leo.

Adjust your shell command to where python and leo lives on your machine, 
(found in Edit-&gt;Setting-&gt;Tabs).

If you were only going to have one and you weren't going to destroy it,
you could just do something simple like c._matplot = self in its
constrictor (assuming c was passed to the constructor).

If you're going to have more than one and they may be destroyed, it
might be simplest to let the free_layout / nested_splitter system manage
them.

ts = c.free_layout.get_top_splitter()
matplotters = ts.findChildren(myMatplotWidget)

should return a list of the widgets of your class in the layout, but
only if they're in the main window, widgets in extra windows opened
from the "Open window" context menu item would be missed, I can add a
find_children() method to complement the find_child() method the
splitters already have to account for this.

Detail: the above is just using Qt's QObject.findChildren(), the
nested_splitter find_child() and (not yet written) find_children()
versions search the extra windows as well.

&gt; Here I have created a self.mat in your MatplotPaneProvider class to make 
&gt; the windget accessible but it doesn't feel like the correct way to do this. 

It should probably provide a fresh myMatplotWidget every time it's
called, so don't construct one in the Provider's init, but in the
ns_provide method.

&gt; from PyQt4 import QtGui
&gt; class MatplotPaneProvider:
&gt; def __init__(self, c):
&gt;      self.c = c
&gt;     * self.mat = myMatplotWidget()*
&gt;      if hasattr(c, 'free_layout'):
[snip]  
&gt; I would also like to make the widget accessible from any script within 
&gt; leo. What's the leo way of doing this?*

See above.

&gt; If I create more than 1 pane containing these widgest. How do I switch 
&gt; between them in scripts?*

Above again :-)
 
&gt; Running this script more than once creates multiple items for Add 
&gt; Matplot when pressing the Action button. How do I stop this from happening? 
&gt; I have alrewady tried returning a unique integer in * ns_provider_id *but 
&gt; that did not work.*

The value returned by ns_provider_id should be unique for the provider
class, but constant.  So it can just return "matplotlib provider ver 1"
or something.</t>

That's why enabling requires @bool scripting-at-script-nodes = True as
well as the abbreviation specific stuff.  The risk seems equivalent to
the scripting-at-script-nodes = True risk.

&gt; &gt; Here's a quick screencast of the template expansions:  
&gt; 
&gt; I loved this screencast.  Could you tell us the tool chain that you
&gt; used to produce it?

I used (gtk-)recordmydesktop.  I used the non-gui version,
recordmydesktop, with the window ID, after hitting some snag I can't
remember with the gui version, gtk-recordmydesktop.  But I couldn't
work out avconv parameters to convert the ogv format to something more
common, and although vimeo seemed to understand it well enough to
upload the video and present the first frame, it wasn't viewable
there.  recordmydesktop "just worked", which was nice.

I'll look at the Python 3 issues.

This is great work, Terry.  Many thanks for it.

Just installed the leo_test branch and have taken a careful look at

1. The exec statement in abbrevClass.finishCreate should be rewritten
for Python3.  Please make sure the code passes all unit tests when
unitTest.leo is run with Python3.

2. The same exec statement appears to allow the execution of arbitrary
Python code.  I'm not sure how comfortable I am with that.  Any

Aside from that, all looks well.  Feel free to merge with the trunk
after ensuring that the code works with Python 3.

include computed values and place holders which you can step through,
filling in a template.  Edward, these changes involve some core code,
although I think they're quite benign, but pls. see change notes at
the bottom of this email.

Here's a quick screencast of the template expansions:
http://www.greygreen.org/tmp/leoabbrev.ogv
I tried uploading it to Vimeo, but that seems to have failed
(http://www.vimeo.com/48019375)

Here are the draft docs. for abbreviations:

Abbreviations are very versatile. You can type ``def;;``, and Leo will
prompt you for a function name, detect whether the function needs a
``self`` parameter, ask for a list of parameters, and expand your input
(just ``"some_function"`` and ``"one, two, three=4"`` to something
like:: 
    def some_function(one, two, three=4):
        """some_function - Return &lt;|return|&gt;
    
        :Parameters:
        - `one`: &lt;|describe one|&gt;
        - `two`: &lt;|describe two|&gt;
        - `three`: &lt;|describe three|&gt;

        Created: Wed Aug 22 10:32:54 CDT 2012
        """
    
        &lt;|code|&gt;

The first placeholder, ``&lt;|return|&gt;`` will be selected, so you can
begin typing in the right place. Hitting ``,,`` will select the next
place holder, and so on.

They can also close XML tags, enter balanced indented markup for
various languages, etc.

Here's a list of `@settings` which relate to abbreviations.

@bool enable-abbreviations = False
    True: enable abbreviations
    False disable abbreviations
    
    Typically you would enable abbreviations in myLeoSettings.leo or in
individual .leo files.
@data global-abbreviations &amp; @data abbreviations
    # Comments lines (lines starting with '#') are ignored.
    # Non-comment lines should have the form::
    #
    #    name=definition
    
    # Definitions in @data abbreviation nodes override definitions in
@data # global-abbreviation nodes. Typically you would define @data
abbreviation nodes # in myLeoSettings.leo
@string abbreviations-subst-start = None
    If this @string is set to something other than None, *and*
    @bool scripting-at-script-nodes = True, then substitutions
    will be made when abbreviations are inserted.  For example
    set abbreviations-subst-start to ``{|{`` and
    abbreviations-subst-end to ``}|}`` and an abbreviation
    like::
    
        date;;={|{import time;x=time.asctime()}|}
    
    will expand to something like "Mon Aug 20 22:00:40 2012"
    
    See also abbreviations-subst-env.
@string abbreviations-subst-end = }|}
    See abbreviations-subst-start.  This setting,
    abbreviations-subst-end, has no effect if
    abbreviations-subst-start is not set.
@data abbreviations-subst-env
    If abbreviations-subst-start is set (see that 
    @setting), the code in this node will be executed, once
    only, when the outline is loaded, in an environment which
    will be used for execution of substitutions in
    abbreviations.  For example, if this node contains
    ``import time``, then an abbreviation like::
    
        date;;={|{import time;x=time.asctime()}|}
    
    can be written more simply as::
    
        date;;={|{x=time.asctime()}|}
    
    The environment will contain `c` and `g`, a dict called `_values`
    (see ask() and get() in @data abbreviations-subst-env), and
    `_abr`, the abbreviation being expanded.
    
    Start lines with `\\:` to preserve indentation.
@@data abbreviations examples
    See the node for examples of advanced abbreviations with
    substitutions.
@string abbreviations-place-start = &lt;|
    Start of a placeholder for template expansions.  E.g.
    the `&lt;|` in::
    
        w;;=while &lt;|condition|&gt;:
        \\:    &lt;|code|&gt;
    
    This would expand with the `&lt;|condition|&gt;` selected, and `,,`,
    if that's an abbreviation linked to next_place(), see 
    @@data abbreviations examples, would select `&lt;|code|&gt;`.
@string abbreviations-place-end = \\|&gt;
    The end of a placeholder for template expansions, e.g.
    `|&gt;`. See @string abbreviations-place-start.


Edward - to look at the changes in theory you could go to

http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~terry-n-brown/+junk/leo_test/revision/5430?compare_revid=5424

but in practice I think the lack of context there makes that useless,
an you might want to just pull
http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~terry-n-brown/+junk/leo_test and look at
it with `bzr qlog`.

Some of the code is in masterCommand, which is why I wanted you to look
at it, but it's guarded by if c.abbrev_subst_start:, so it won't do
anything unless enabled.

Re: "toggle between the custom and default leosettings"

This only occurs when the leo session in which I edited the
myLeoSettings file remains in session - I can then cause the toggle to
occur. Once you leave the the leo session, it always loads 
myLeoSettings.leo as expected. 

It took me quite some time to reproduce; when I finally realised how I 
managed to toggle themes
in leo I thought it would be a nice feature to have :)

Lewis

Thanks for asking a question, rather than immediately filing a bug report
:-)

The general idea is that opening either of the two settings files must be
handled as something of a special case.  Furthermore, certain settings
(like enabled plugins) are inherently "cumulative": the add to what is
already in effect, rather than override what is in effect.

Settings probably work as one would naively expect when you open a clean
copy of Leo, but there may be some glitches when you open additional
files.  If there is specific behavior that you find dubious, please
describe exactly what it is.  We can discuss it, and you can then file a
bug report if you like.

&gt; BTW, I'm slightly bothered by the fact that color variable names have
&gt; "solarized" in them. You are supposed to create new themes by changing

&gt; any more.
&gt; 
&gt; how about "@leotheme-c-0" (for color 0) etc.

The variable replacement runs up to ten levels deep, after which it
bails assuming you've created a loop :-)

So there's nothing wrong with 

  @solarized-yellow = #abcdef

the issue is that `@solarized-yellow` is used in the guts of the
stylesheet definition.  Instead, ideally, but I didn't get to it, in
the config node you'd have

  @solarized-yellow = #abcdef
  ...
  @highlight-hot = @solarized-yellow

and then use `@highlight-hot` in the guts of the
stylesheet definition.

Note - you can't create new themes simply by editing the config
node, it's not possible to create enough constants for every style
element that can be addressed by a stylesheet.

But it would be nice to move all the color and numeric constants out of
the stylesheet and into the config node as I've described above, just a
find and replace operation.

I agree.  Otoh, I am willing to look into creating a true solarized

I just pushed the solarized dark theme to trunk.  There were some
changes to core code, but nothing too major, and I've been using it for
some time.

In leoSettings.leo there's a new top-level node called 'Themes', which
contains a single theme node at the moment, you can copy that to you
myLeoSettings.leo file under @settings.  Read the README node of the
theme node for more instructions.

The theme is far from perfect - it's relatively easy to get it looking
ok if you're already running a dark desktop theme, which is what I'm
doing, but much harder if you want Leo dark in a light desktop theme,
as you need to theme everything.

 - see the README - if you're already running a dark theme there's a
   `base` node which can be switched to `@ignore base` to take more
   advantage of your desktop theme.

 - note that the new theme system includes a stylesheet authoring 
   tool with macro substitutions :-) you no longer edit
   @data qt-gui-plugin-style-sheet directly but edit a more comfortable
   Leo tree version and then run-script on the appropriate node to

Hi Terry,

Many thanks for your work on the dark theme.
I noticed that the behaviour of the theme is affected by it's up/down 
position in the @settings tree:
If before 'Plugins' it is pale (but boxes are dark), after 'Plugins' it's 
dark all over as intended.
It may be helpful to document the behaviour.

A question for Edward - Clicking the menu Help&gt;Open leoSettings.leo and 
Help&gt;Open myLeoSettings.leo operates as an immediate toggle between the  
custom and default leosettings.
Is that toggle intended? I would have expected that leo should behave 
according to the users preferred settings in their myLeoSettings.leo file.

Thanks - the docs. in the theme node do mention moving other @data
qt-gui-plugin-style-sheet and @color nodes out of the way, but I've
added a couple of notes about putting it at the bottom of the @setting
list to ensure it overrides other settings.  The problem is when the 
default theme's @data qt-gui-plugin-style-sheet node comes after
the dark theme's.

Maybe the theme shouldn't be called 'solarized', although the color

There is one glitch that I see.  It appears that the border around the body 
pane has disappeared.  I think the border is always important, and the 
proper border color will likely change in the solarized version.  But 
perhaps this is an artifact of my settings--I really haven't investigated

So I made a post.  I could not work out how to get the STATIC_PATH
mechanism working, despite RTFM and reading the source.  So I just
modified the Makefile to copy static/* into output.

Also in the source repo

make github
make: ghp-import: Command not found

so I just copied the output into the blog repo as Ville described - we
need a better way of doing that.

Finally it needs to handle images better, preferable a scaled version
that expands to full size when clicked - but I'm sure that's possible.

Wondering what the relationship between posts about plugins and the

The trick is that if you have e.g.

you need to put the static files under 'content', i.e. in content/images

I have now added "fabfile.py" with recipe for easy publishing. You need
Fabric installed (usual pip stuff) to use it.

Your workflow will probably be:

"make html"

(or more likely, you'll have devserver running at all times for live
preview)

When you are happy, do "fab publish" and this should publish the updated
version to git.

The script will instruct you if you are doing something wrong, but I
recommend you to review it before trusting it too much.

I pushed some updated content to the blog, and created a repository to host
the "sources" from which the blog is generated here:

https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-blog

Browsing the source should be instructive.

After installing the dependencies and checking out that repo, you should be
able to "make html" or (better) "make devserver" and browse the result in
"output" directory. What I did was cp -r the contents of "output/"
directory to the publishing repository (
https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor.github.io), but we can probably
make it quite easy in the future.

Stand alone GUI free index builder for Leo's full text search system::

  python leoftsindex.py &lt;file1&gt; &lt;file2&gt; &lt;file3&gt;...

If &lt;file&gt; does not contain '#' it's assumed to be a .leo file

If &lt;file&gt; does contain '#' it's assumed to be a .leo file
containing a list of .leo files to index, with the list in
the node indicated by the UNL after the #, e.g.::

   path/to/myfile.leo#Lists--&gt;List of outlines

In the latter case, if the node identified by the UNL has children,
the list of files to scan is built from the first line of the body
of each child node of the identified node (works well with bookmarks.py).
If the node identified by the UNL does not have children, the
node's body is assumed to be a simple text listing of paths to .leo files).

.. note::

Now I have basic functionality pushed to trunk.

If you want to "spawn" (posibbly several) system commands to background,
use g.procs.add(), like this ctrl+b script:

def L(*args):
    g.es("callback", args)

g.procs.add(['sleep', '4'], "que1")
g.procs.add(['sleep', '3'], "que1", L)
g.procs.add(['sleep', '2'], "que1")
g.procs.add(['sleep', '2'], "que2")

Note how que2 completes first. Idea is that commands in same queue depend
on each other, and thus need to run in sequential order.

This should make waiting for long lasting operations easier as the whole
Leo won't freeze until they are over (but you can still use the stdout /
stderr output from these calls, thanks to the optional callback)

API may change once I start using it (soon).

&gt; blocking Leo or ipython terminal.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd like to show stderr and stdout in g.es, or separate log page, and
&gt; provide callback after task has been completed.

There's the leoscreen stuff for integration with the GNU `screen`
terminal switcher / manager.  Push lines from the body to the terminal,
pull lines back the other way.  But more for interactive interaction
with terminal programs than batch oriented work.  Leo doesn't block.

===== Ville

A challenge I can imagine with the "screen" workflow is detecting when a
command has been executed (and capturing stderr/stdout). Do you have a
solution for that in mind?

===== Terry

I tried more direct communication (subprocess.Popen.communicate()) before
the screen approach, it's hard and probably app. specific. leoscreen avoids
that by basically being interactive, so it might not be a fit for your
case. Basically it's leveraging the intelligence of the user to keep track
of execution.

My vote is for Ctrl-plus/minus, and to Ctrl-scroll-wheel, because these are
consistent across a great many other programs.

It's unfortunate Ctrl-- is already used for for "replace and continue
search", but like others I didn't know about it so haven't become
habituated to it. Who experience pain if this was changed?

I can't find the thread, but I thought we once discussed reducing the number
of bindings defined by default.

running &lt;alt-x&gt; print-bindings makes it clear why it's a challenge to identify
unused bindings.

Maybe each binding has users, but I would expect that most don't.

Is anyone depending on
alt-ctrl-a = toggle-find-wrap-around-option ?

The fewer bindings out of the box, the easier it is for folks extending Leo.

I think a painless way to simplify Leo would be to have a more concise
set of default bindings.

Kent

This can always be done in myLeoSettings.leo, but I share your concern.

I have the lurking feeling that it would be possible to do some lightweight
modes that define temporary bindings.  This is theoretically possible now
with @mode, but I doubt anyone uses it.  I sure don't.

This could be an important addition to Leo, but for now I've filed it under
Leo/Later :-)

Edward, and anyone else using

this no longer does anything...

now you need to edit

  @data qt-gui-plugin-style-sheet

and change

  @focused-border-style = none

to

  @focused-border-style = solid

for the default theme, if you're using the dark theme, now known as
leo_dark_0, same deal but after editing as above remember to select

Xiki.org gives a demo of a "wiki" shell for command execution. Leo should 
be able to do the same thing (and more!), in the sense that leoscreen, for 
example, has two way communication with the command line. I suppose a 
"Lxiki" is really just a question of setting up the right shortcuts (like a 
shift-ctrl-b that would run highlighted python code from the command 
line... with a tmp file?).

Just an idea for the Leo melting pot.

Thanks for the tip -- it will take me a while to get my head around vspace
(will keep an eye on Ville's blog post).

I'm just beginning to appreciate (or imagine) what Ipython, sublime text
editor, leo, xiki, etc could mean for some kind of intelligent document
workbench. Of course the big hurdle is not so much the string processing
(sublime is a good example of how that can be done), but rather the syntax
processing -- i.e. the docbench  (to coin a phrase) should understand the
syntax of whatever is being input and then offer syntax-aware functions....
Sorry, getting a little obscure: all I mean by syntax-aware is the ability
to propose text completions (Leo's autocompletion is a good example --
everything should work like autocomplete!) and allow for intelligent text
changes depending on a database of information (for example, a search and
replace that would  know how to search on "caterpillar" and turn it into
"butterfly" but would not touch "caterpillar truck").

Seems like Leo is not far from doing that synthesis, but it would require
more database integration. So for example, even the python help system does
not have autocomplete. (No criticism there! The great thing about Leo is
that if you want something, you just have to dive in and build it. My day
job might just let me do that!)

Thanks!

Got it! The value of valuespace (!) is that that you can make a pythonesque
session persist. I did not realize that there was no direct two-way bridge
to the python window that leo launches. Even if there were, we would want
to make the session persist by logging it into the outline, as
valuespace (vs-create-tree) does.

Thanks for getting me up and running.

&gt; 
&gt; Just an idea for the Leo melting pot. 

In addition to the outline as a active data document functions of
Ville's value-space plugin, I recently added some simple ;-) commands:

Alt+A vs-eval
Alt+S vs-last
Alt+D vs-last-pretty
(my key bindings)

vs-eval evaluates the selected python in the c.vs namespace.  It makes
an effort to workout what the output should be, and puts it in the
log.  It captures print output to the log too.  It selects the next
line, ready for execution.

vs-last inserts the last result into the body, and vs-last-pretty
does the same, but using pprint formatting.

Ctrl-B also runs the script in the body, but not in a persistent
namespace, running only the selected text doesn't seem to be working,
and it doesn't work so hard to work out the output.

I guess leoscreen would do the same things as the vs-* commands if you
used it against a python shell.  The inspiration for the vs-* commands
was wanting Leo to tell you what 3.57 * 365 / 12 was without a lot of
effort, but of course you can define functions etc. etc.

Something I've found useful is adding a @click node like:

Thanks.  I could have sworn I searched Leo's core for @rclick.  Must have
been a searching failure :-)  The code is in
qtIconBarClass.setCommandForButton.

I'll add documentation for this, in leoSettings.leo and also in the

I don't think Leo constantly updates p.b from w.getAllText(), but just
does it when focus is lost - not sure about that though.

Here's a thought for a higher level interface.

c.get_edit_state() gives you an instance of a LeoEditState class with
these attributes:

  text attributes

  les.all_text
  les.text_before_select
  les.text_after_select
  les.selected_text
  les.text_before_cursor
  les.text_after_cursor

  integer attributes

  les.selection_start
  les.selection_end
  les.cursor_index

then you can either do

c.set_edit_state(les)

which sets the editor text and p.b to les.all_text and sets up
selection and insert position appropriately from the integers,

or c.set_edit_state(les, mode='selection')
or c.set_edit_state(les, mode='cursor')

which assembles things based on the selection or cursor text attributes.

Thoughts?  So long since I wrote any emacs text manipulation stuff I
can't remember the idiom it used.

Cheers -Terry

Your workflow make sense for the general case of doing any arbitrary
thing with Leo.  For the specific case of manipulating text, I think
the API could be improved, or, seeing the existing API make sense for
what it is, we could have additional "easy text manipulation" API.
So long since I used Emacs I can't really remember its model, and if it

I have read the scripting chapter of leo-editor, and already make my daily
life easier with these quick dirty, but useful scripts.

And I just want to know your workflow of writing leo scripts.

My workflow is like this
[e.g., I want to select some text in the body and make transform, then
insert to the body again]:

1. Abstract the action of word.
[in this case, I choose "select" and "insert" as my key words]

2. search the words at http://leoeditor.com/scripting.html see if there is
existing some related topics.
[I have luck to find
i = w.getInsertPoint()              # Return the location of the cursor.
...
i,j = w.getSelectionRange(sort=True)
...
s = w.getSelectedText()             # Return the selected text, if any.
]

3. but I still don't know how to insert the text to body. So I search the
above function names in the scripts.leo to see the code.
[ I find in
scripts.leo#Scripts--&gt;@thin leoScripts.txt--&gt;Text editing scripts--&gt;insert
begin/endUpdate
...
w.insert(i,s1+'\\n\\t\\t\\n'+s2)
...
seems to help
]

4. test the scripts to see if it works, if it doesn't work, go to 3, to
find more example code.

Any suggestion to improve this workflow?

Rickard,

Very interesting--I'm happy to see someone thinking about how to make 
understanding code bases easier.  (I'm a rather old wannabee programmer, so 
I'm not sure it will ever be of much use to me, nor that I can offer cogent 
comments.)

I will add some comments or questions anyway: ;-)

   * Are you familiar with the concept of literate programming as espoused by 
Donald Knuth and others?  If so, did that influence you at all, and, if so 
how?  (Not that I think literate programming is the way forward, although I 
like the concept and have experimented with it--I once wrote a rather large 
Visual Basic (I know, what can I say, I was stuck in the Microsoft world at 
the time) program using a literate programming approach.  I got it working to 
a degree, but eventually had to devote more time to other things so never got 
it fully up to spec.

   * Darn, I know I had another comment, but I won't remember it until 
sometime after I hit "send" ;-)

The main purpose of my email is to encourage you--anything that can improve 
the understanding of a code base is a good thing--thanks for your efforts!

&gt;    * Are you familiar with the concept of literate programming as espoused by
&gt; Donald Knuth and others?

Yes. I've read about literate programming and also tried it. I found that it
didn't work so well for me for the following reasons (At least that's what I
remember. It was many years since I tried.):

* Focus on text first instead of code made it harder for me to produce working
  code. I sometimes learn how to do something by trying it out and then
  refactor the solution.

* Unless you read the PDF (or whatever the final output is) you loose the
  structure. At least I did. It was just one big file with all kinds of things
  mixed together. An outline structure solves this problem.

&gt; If so, did that influence you at all, and, if so
&gt; how?  (Not that I think literate programming is the way forward, although I
&gt; like the concept and have experimented with it--I once wrote a rather large
&gt; Visual Basic (I know, what can I say, I was stuck in the Microsoft world at
&gt; the time) program using a literate programming approach.  I got it working to
&gt; a degree, but eventually had to devote more time to other things so never got
&gt; it fully up to spec.

It influenced me mostly in that I started to think about how to best present
programs so that humans can understand them. I'm not sure literate programming
like Knuth uses it is the best way (in particular, I think the programs are
harder to modify), but I also think that a folder with just source code is not
so good either.

&gt; The main purpose of my email is to encourage you--anything that can improve
&gt; the understanding of a code base is a good thing--thanks for your efforts!

Thanks for the encouragements.

Nice article Rickard, I think it captures the background problem well.

I'm not sure the images communicate clones effectively -- but don't really
have an alternative suggestion that would be an improvement. It's just
really hard to appreciate how well they work without experiencing them!

Interesting - the python web application framework Django is really
tough in that regard, you might simultaneously want to work on python,
html template, css, java-script, url-dispatch, tests, model definitions.
In fact I've just made some updates to the bookmarks display plugin
which make using it effectively smoother, for a mouse user, anyway, to
help with this.  Will push them soon.

I'm slowly trying to grok leo. I love meld, it's simply the best text
comparison I've ever seen. I wonder if a greater bit of integration between
meld and leo is possible, and in which ways. Undoubtedly calling it as an
external process is better than anything.

Useful!

For fun (and perhaps of some use), here is a brute compare of trees. I use
meld, which has a great interface.

I think I will set up a pyflakes button as well; I haven't seen it as part
of Leo, though the Leo error python messages are good.

I tried this one and it seems to be very useful. What I would also like to 
have is a similar (or the same) script,
that does the same on two different nodes of a leo file. I admit, the 
changes should be minimal to be done by
myself, but as I'm not familiar with the internal leo api, I wanted to ask 
for how to best do this changes.

Probably somewhere here
"""

vf = from_c.hiddenRootNode 
vt = to_c.hiddenRootNode

just to feed in the 2 nodes, Any quick idea how this can be done the best 
way?

The script below is a tool for diffing two Leo files. The attached
screenshot illustrates the output for two different revisions of
LeoPyRef.leo.

``- nodename``
    indicates a node which disappeared
``+ nodename``
    a node which is new,
``!v nodename`` followed by ``!^ nodename``
    a node with an unchanged heading but changed content, the first
    linking to the old version, the second linking to the new version

If you have the bookmarks.py plugin active, you can double click nodes
to jump to the original(s).

&gt; The revised r.div method will be something like::

&gt;     def div(self,aList):
&gt;         compute old and new indents
&gt;         return [

&gt;             &lt;/div&gt;, with old indent,
&gt;         ]
&gt;

This doesn't work!  aList won't have the proper indentation.  In 
particular, the following won't work::

    [['  ',z] for z in aList],

flatten_list will add the two spaces before the line, that is, before a 
newline. Instead, a hack is needed:

    return [
        div,
        join_list(aList,indent='  '),
        '\\n&lt;/div&gt;'
    ]

The new 'indent' keyword tells flatten_list to add the given indentation 
(two spaces, here), to strings that start with a newline.  The new code in 
flatten_list is::

        for i,item in enumerate(aList):
            if leading:                  yield leading
            for s in flatten_list(item):
                if indent:
                    if s.startswith('\\n'):
                        yield '\\n'+indent+s[1:]
                    else:
                        yield s
                else:
                    yield s
            if sep and i &lt; len(aList)-1: yield sep
            if trailing:                 yield trailing

The point is that the indentation must be "moved behind the newline".

Thanks for these links.  Yes, there is a similarity.  However, the real 
beauty of new pattern is the flatten_list method.  It's the combination of 
the lists and flatten_list that gives the pattern real power.  We've just 
seen how the 'indent' keyword hack allows sophisticated processing of the

Yes, it's indeed an interesting pattern.

It would seem more useful in faster languages than python though; in
python, string operations (and gc) are faster in comparison to executing
other code, whereas in fast, more static languages (C++, Java, Go) avoiding
GC gives you great benefits (I saw 5x perf increase reported for some Go
app when eliminating GC).

Thanks for these remarks.  I've enjoyed thinking about them.  A few 
responses:

1. This is a smallish pattern--it can't change the world, except insofar as 
something beautiful changes the world.

2. Otoh, the pattern changes the way I think about lisp and lisp-like 
patterns.  That's not nothing. For the first time, it makes list-oriented  
programming pattern completely safe.  It does this because it doesn't 
matter what each component list contains, nor does it matter *at all* what 
the shape of any part of the tree is.  This makes the pattern completely 
flexible.

3. The pattern can be generalized.  The pattern I described uses a tree of 
component strings to describe a (large) resulting string.  But one can 
easily imagine using lists to hold anything at all (of whatever tree shape) 
and then use another version of flatten_list to compose results of other 
types.  Alternatively, rather than composing a result, the analog of 
flatten_list could process the tree of lists in other ways.  So the most 
general version of the pattern is:

A) The tree of lists can contain any data whatever, especially including 
None,
B) The "producers" (visitors) can create subtrees of whatever shape,
C) The analog of flatten_list is free to do anything whatever with the 
resulting tree.

I suspect that these features are what appeal to lisp programmers ;-)

4. I'm not sure whether the pattern is more useful in "faster" languages or 
not.  True, anything that helps a feeble language like C++ will seem useful 
:-)  But points 1-3 above have nothing to do with speed: they just make 
programming simpler, more flexible, more powerful and more fun.

Imo, gc issues are important both in Python and in C++.  For stc, the only 
way to get reproducible timing statistics for tests was to do the following 
before running the test::

    for z in (0,1,2): gc.collect(z)

The ReportTraverser class no longer contains *any* calls to string.join, so 
one could imagine that all strings used in the code would be interned.  The 
generated tree actually contains nothing but *references* to strings, and 
if all strings are interned the references will not themselves cause any 
new strings to be allocated.

Naturally, gc issues are even more important in language like C++ without a 
gc.  Lol.  The preceding paragraph is more important for C++ than in 
Python.  So yes, in this sense I agree with you completely that the pattern 
is more useful for "fast" languages than for Python.

Thanks, Ville, for provoking all these pleasant thoughts :-)

&gt; Nice.  An HTML specific approach which avoids things like the
&gt; r.div_end() construct is the LXML element factory:
&gt; http://lxml.de/tutorial.html#the-e-factory
&gt;

Beautiful.  With the list framework the revised r.div method would be
something like::

    def div(self,aList):
        compute old and new indents
        return [
            &lt;div&gt;, with old indent,
            aList, with new indent,
            &lt;/div&gt;, with old indent,
        ]

An example of the pattern in use::

    return [
        ...
        r.div([
            contents of the div,
        ]),
        ...
    ]

Similarly for span, etc. Thanks for pointing this out.  This is too good to
ignore.  I'll do it soon.

I was wondering if the Qt widget used for body text has a provision for 
background images?

I'm thinking that it might be interesting to have some wallpapers/tiles to 
visually represent various categories of methods, e.g. initors, setters, 
getters, etc.  Maybe ones that hint at the uses of a particular design 
pattern.  Maybe us a uA to control setting?

Sorry for the delay in responding.  Leo's body pane is a QTextBrowser:
http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qtextbrowser.html
a subclass of QTextEdit.  QTextBrowser also inherits from QFrame and
QWidget, so there *might* be a way to have a background image "leak"

QTextEdit#richTextEdit { background-image: url('/home/tbrown/Desktop/cow2.jpg'); }

in the stylesheet gives the effect attached (i.e. it works).

If you wanted node specific backgrounds Leo would have to start setting
an attribute on the body widget, probably the gnx, so you could do

QTextEdit#richTextEdit[leo_gnx='tbrown.20130430222443.19340'] { 
  background-image: url('/home/tbrown/Desktop/cow2.jpg');

Wow!  Thanks for this.  LeoUser wrote a version of Leo in Jython (using the
Swing classes), and he claimed that he could watch *movies* in the body
pane :-)

I'll add this to the Leo/To Document list.  Not sure yet how that list is
going to get translated into action.  Still reading Getting Things Done :-)

You could run this script (below):

It only exports selected nodes, so if you want to export everything,
you have to select all the top level nodes, i.e. collapse all the nodes
so only the top level is visible, click the first one, and shift-click
the last one.

It exports to plain text... although you might be able to use the
template to describe HTML, not sure.

---cut here---
# template is everything between r""" and second """
# placeholders are H heading B body C children
# use \\n in B and C lines for conditional blank lines

template = r"""H
    B

Right.  Paste the content into a node, then click the script-button
button to create a new button for running this script.  The button's
name will be the node's name, what it is doesn't matter but 'export'
would be an obvious choice.  Then select the node(s) you want exported
- presumably not including the node containing the script :)

Then it will ask for a file name and whether to include unexpanded
nodes.

Rev 5432 provides some answers.  test.leo contains the node, "Prototype of 
screencast script".  It took many hours of happy experimentation to get the 
script to work, but the results are worth all the futzing.  Here is the 
first script::

    s = p.b # This script.
    c = c.new()
    p = c.p
    p.h = ''
    n1,n2 = 0.01,0.2 # Small difference are important.
    head_keys('This is headline text',n1,n2)
    body_keys('This is some body text.\\n',0.0,0.0) # n1,n2)
    body_keys('Some more body text.\\n',0.0,0.0)
    body_keys(s,0.0,0.0)

The head_keys and body_keys (not shown) simulate typing, with a range of 
typing speed indicated by the n1 and n2 params.  The result is really fun 
to watch.  As you will see, there is a wait method that waits a variable 
number of seconds.  This will be useful in other contexts.

This is the most fun I've had in quite awhile. It's becoming clear that 
being able to generate screencasts from scripts will be an excellent tool 
for those trying to explain Leo.  Imo, creating screencasts from such 
scripts will be *much* simpler than making slideshows.

I've got lots of ideas for improvements to screencasts.  I should have 
something pretty cool to show in a week or so...

Edward

P.S.  The head_keys and body_keys methods cost me a *lot* of work.  It's 
tricky to show the typing immediately without flash.  These are the first 
of several planned helper methods for use in screencasts::

     def head_keys(s,n1=0.04,n2=0.1):
        import leo.core.leoGui as leoGui
        p = c.p
        tree = c.frame.tree
        c.editHeadline()
        w = tree.edit_widget(p)
        for ch in s:
            p.h = p.h + ch
            tree.repaint() # *not* tree.update.
            wait(n1,n2)
            event = leoGui.leoKeyEvent(c,ch,ch,w,x=0,y=0,x_root=0,y_root=0)
            c.k.masterKeyHandler(event)
        c.frame.tree.repaint()
        c.redraw()

    def body_keys(s,n1=0.04,n2=0.1):
        c.bodyWantsFocusNow()
        p = c.p
        w = c.frame.body.bodyCtrl.widget
        for ch in s:
            p.b = p.b + ch
            w.repaint()
            wait(n1,n2)
        c.redraw()

From: "Edward K. Ream" &lt;edreamleo@gmail.com&gt;

The more I think about it, the more I think Leo needs an automated playback 
capability.  I had some initial thoughts in the thread, "PyOhio Leo Video 
up on youtube", 
https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/leo-editor/nmBweM3wI3o.

There as several immediate applications for automated playback:

1. As a helper for those preparing demos of Leo.  It eliminates the need to 
think, talk and type at the same time ;-)  The hope is that the narrator 
would be more comfortable and relaxed during the recording, but perhaps 
that is wishful thinking.

2. As an automated, scripted, demo of what Leo can do.  You could even 
imagine the quickstart.leo would "create itself" when it was opened.  You 
would simply need to start the demo when the file was opened!

As I was thinking about playback, I considered how the playback would draw 
attention to various parts of the screen.  In other words, we need 
something akin to the big red arrows in the Leo slideshows. One easy way to 
do this would be with a DialogWithImage call, that would pop up a dialog 
showing, say, a magnified image of a dirty icon box.  Depending on options, 
the dialog might go away after a few seconds, or remain until the use hits 
any key.

The main question is, how easy will it be to create and edit playbacks?  
I'm not sure.  Any such playback capability would essentially be a 
(detailed!) script.  We can imagine a script that is essentially Python:  
Something like:

goto_sibling_node(&lt;&lt;node name&gt;&gt;)
dialog(&lt;&lt;dialog name&gt;&gt;,&lt;&lt; when dismissed&gt;&gt;)
edit_headline
type_individual_letters('This is the headline',&lt;&lt;delay between letters&gt;&gt;)
type_text('This is the headline')
insert_sibling_node()
insert_child_node()
select_find_tab()
etc! etc!

Leo already has most of the capability go generate this as we use Leo:  
it's the so-called "lossage" history in k.masterKeyHandler.  I'm thinking 
that there is no urgent need to capture the mouse: we might as well 
demonstrate mouseless Leo!

Actually, we might forgo capturing actions altogether, and just write the 
script directly.  We'll have to see whether that makes sense.

Your comments, please, Amigos.

&gt;

Screencasts promise to be easy to be *much* easier to create than 
slideshows, while also being more interesting, informative and flashy.  It 
is *so* much easier to write a screencast script than it is to lay out a 
slide, take a screenshot, and then manage resulting slide.

In particular, there are few continuity problems with screencasts.  
Continuity is a *huge* problem with slideshows!  If I change one slide, I 
am likely to want to change all following slides.  Which means I have to 
retake all the slides, and file the new versions in the proper places.  In 
contrast, any changes to screencasts naturally propagate forward.  There 
might be an effect on following screencasts scenes, but this will happen 
rarely with a reasonable scene design, and any problems should be easy to 
fix.

With screencasts, the *movie* script is also the *python* script!  There is 
no "translation" from one to the other.  Furthermore, all the work to 
produce a screencast is done (naturally!) within Leo.  No need to create 
and manage external data.  This is another huge advantage and it make 
producing screencasts much faster than producing slideshows.

Screencasts are likely to be the long-awaited tools that will allow me to 
show Leo in action so that other will finally be able to understand it 
easily.  This is an exciting prospect!

The arguments to m.wait specify the range of waiting allowed.  The plugin 
multiplies these nominal factors by a **speed factor**, initially 1.0.  
m.set_speed sets this factor. To double the presentation speed, set the 
factor to 0.5.

The m.log call writes a message to the log pane, with calls to m.wait(1) 
before and after inserting the text.  Both waits are important.  The 
"opening" wait allows the user to see the effect of the previous operation; 
the "closing" wait allows the user to read the new comment in the log pane 
before the next operation happens.

3. The futzing with speed and waits convinces me that specifying waits "by 
hand" isn't good enough.  Pre-specified waits will be useful only for an 
**unattended mode** that just plays the screencast from start to finish.  
But for most presentations we want the presenter to switch from one 
**scene** of the movie to the next by hitting the RightArrow key.  The 
LeftArrow key will go back to the previous scene. Thus, in **attended 
mode**, most calls to m.wait will have no effect.  (An exception will be 
the calls to m.wait in the code the simulates a person typing in headline 
or body text.  Thus calls should always have effect, so we will have a 
"force" arg to m.wait.)

It will be relatively straightforward to do the first draft of attended 
mode.  At the programming level, it will work like any minibuffer command 
that prompts for user input.  That is, the plugin will create a so-called 
state handler for the slideshow.

At the design level,  the main idea is to treat every node under the main 
@screencast node as a scene.  This natural division allows the screencast 
to organize the material using all of Leo's organizational capabilities.

The state handler will, when seeing the RightArrow key, "play" the next 
scene merely by moving to the next node and then executing the script in 
it's body text.  This script could contain *any* Leo script, but most often 
it will call ScreenCastController methods.   Moving to the previous scene 
can be done by Leo's undo command, automatically managed by the 
ScreenCastController.  This will be a bit tricky, but not hugely so.

4. Putting comments in the log pane is ok for a prototype, but it's pretty 
lame.  Instead, I'd like to use some kind of popup that can be associated 
with individual items on the screen and located with precision relative to 
those items. The popup should be able to contain both text and graphics. 
Does anyone have a suggestion for what Qt widget to use?

Your comments please, Amigos.

Indeed it was.  Rev  5435 contains the new code in screencast.py and new 
test code in test.leo.  To run the test, just do Alt-9, then hit the right 
arrow key until done.  Escape or Ctrl-g will abort the screencast.  All 
other keys get ignored.

**Warning**: the present screen cast insert a node in a somewhat random 
location.

The code that looks for the next node assumes that if it has a script if 
p.b.strip() is True.  Before making this check, it should strip off python 
comment lines so the speaker can add comments.

There is still lots of work to be done, but already we have a fun sandbox 
to play in.  As you will see, all the code in ScreenCastController is dead 
easy, which bodes well for future work.

I agree. Code can usually be improved.  Your interesting ideas are what are
important.

Once again, we have a problem: how to make this code available to those who
might benefit from it?  More importantly, how to tell others about the work
you have done when we have all forgotten the details of this conversation.
My interim solution is to file this under Leo/To Document, but that is

From: Jacob Peck &lt;gatesphere@gmail.com&gt;

I implemented something in a Leo outline yesterday, but I feel my code 
is absolutely atrocious.

One of the ways I use Leo is as an information management/database for 
when I'm running tabletop RPGs.  Such games involve a fair amount of 
similarly structure data.  I set out to make a way of defining a 
template, and providing macro expansions within the template, so that 
the user could click a script button, be prompted for data, and be 
rewarded with a fully-populated copy of the template.  I've managed to 
accomplish this with the code below:

https://gist.github.com/gatesphere/2be5030506a364ee6ec1

Now, that seems like an atrocious amount of code, and a lot of it feels 
like too much work... but it was a hack, and it works.

How it works is like this:

- Create a `@template` node.  This is the parent node for your template.

- Create a `@destination` node as a child of the @template node. This 
node's headline is the name of a top level node where your completed 
template will be placed.  `@destination Sessions` will place the 
finished product under the top-level "Sessions" node.

- Populate the @template node with various `@item` nodes - these keep 
their structure in the filled template.  Anything that needs to be a 
part of the final product has to be an @item node.

All of that is fine and dandy if you just want to copy and paste... but 
that's already baked into Leo.  So I added macro expansion.  The script 
gathers up all instances of anything that fits the regex "&lt;\\$\\w+&gt;" is a 
macro variable name.  Something like `&lt;$name&gt;` or `&lt;$date&gt;`.  The script 
gathers up all of these variable names, and prompts the user (ala 
todo.py's "Redistribute Priorities" function) for values for each of 
them. They are global with respect to the template, so using the same 
macro variable in multiple places in the same template will result in 
all of them being filled in with the same value.

In addition, there is one more type of node that can go under @template 
nodes - @default.  @default nodes provide a default value for a macro 
variable.  The node with a headline of `@default &lt;$name&gt;` and a body of 
"This is my body" gives the `&lt;$name&gt;` macro a value of "This is my body" 
everywhere within the template, and that macro will not be prompted for 
a value.  This is handy if you're copying templates between Leo 
worksheets, and want them flexible, but don't want them to fill in the 
same value for every single invocation of copy-template.

Here's an example template:

@template &lt;$campaign&gt; Session #&lt;$num&gt; ($date)
       @destination Sessions
       @default &lt;$campaign&gt;
       @item Who's Coming?
       @item In-World Start Date
       @item Log
       @item Threads
             @item High Priority
             @item Low Priority
       @item News
             @item Out of Character
             @item In Character

The body of `@default &lt;$campaign&gt;` is "World of Ka'rim".  The body of 
`@item Who's Coming?` is "John, Jane, Jack, Jenny, Jeremy".

Running copy-template on this template, and filling the values prompted 
for (&lt;$num&gt; and &lt;$date&gt;) gives the following under the top-level node 
Sessions:

World of Ka'rim Session #1 (01 May 2013)
       Who's Coming?
       In-World Start Date
       Log
       Threads
             High Priority
             Low Priority
       News
             Out of Character
             In Character

The headlines bodies are correctly filled in with macro expansions, and 
other text is verbatim copied from the respective headlines and bodies.

So... two questions:

1.) Did I re-implement something Leo already does?
2.) Anyone have any suggestions on reducing the amount of code/any fixes?

Also, hope someone else finds this useful.  Once it's cleaned up, I 
might do a leo-editor blog post about it.

Haven't looked at it hard enough to evaluate code, but it doesn't seem
too excessive for what it does.  I've just been fiddling with the
abbreviations code which does template expansion, but it's aimed at
being more interactive, not having the content stored in the outline,
which makes more sense for you seeing you want to be able to re-run the
template fill-in easily if you make a mistake, without entering
everything again.

I'm not sure how much of this you could achieve with the value-space
plugin, can't remember if that uses Jinja templates for something or
not.

Some people seem to think that it is difficult to understand how Leo
handles "clone wars":  differing values for a cloned nodes that appear
in several external files.  That's not true.  The rule is::

    **The last clone that Leo reads wins.**

That is, for any cloned node C, Leo takes the value of C.h and C.b to
be the values specified by the last copy that Leo reads.

There is only one complication::

    **Leo reads the entire outline before reading any external
files.**

Thus, if C appears in x.leo, y.py and z.py, Leo will choose the value
for C in x.py or y.py, depending on which @&lt;file&gt; node appears later
in the outline.

Notes:

1. Whenever Leo detects multiple values for C when opening an outline,
Leo creates a "Recovered nodes" tree.  This tree contains all the
various values for C, nicely formatted so that it is easy to determine
where the differences are.

2. I've just refreshed my memory by looking at the code.  The relevant
methods are:

    fc.getLeoFile # Reads the outline, then calls at.readAll to read
all external files.
    at.indicateNodeChanged # Adds data to c.nodeConflictList
    cacher.reportChangedClone # Adds data to c.nodeConflictList
    fc.handleNodeConflicts # Creates "Recovered Nodes" node and its
children.

3. The present code is the simplest code that could possibly work.
There is no way Leo is going to do AI in order to implement complex
rules for which clones are "more important" than others.  Thus, if you
use cross-file clones, it is up to *you* to know these rules and
handle any resulting conflicts.  Imo, the "Recovered Nodes" feature is
a big step forward for Leo, and makes it impossible to lose data
unless you willfully refuse to examine the data.

From: Joon Ro &lt;joonpyro@gmail.com&gt;

Thanks for the explanation. As a matter of fact, I was having hard time 
understanding this. 

I had my source file in a @shadow node, and then I had a backup of that 
file as @file node, which had clones of the nodes of the source @shadow 
file and some other codes that I stashed. 

Whenever I changed the source code externally with leo closed, when I open 
leo, it made recovered nodes. The problem was since @file was placed 
"later" in the outline, leo kept putting the new changes I made to old, 
instead of new.

Now I understand how this works. but I think in multiple external file 
cases, it would make more sense if leo checks the file modification time 
when it makes decision which node is new, instead of just depending on the 
order of files in the outline. In above case, it is natural for me to have 
actual source nodes on the top of the outline and backup nodes on the 
bottom. Please let me know what you think. 

Best regards,
Joon

If I want to use leo to make mathematical notes, how can I type in some
special mathematical sysbols? Or is there a good way to make mathematical
notes using leo?

===== Terry

I use itex2MML with reStructuredText.  So within Leo you're looking at
LaTeX math markup, and you get outputs in PDF and XHTML, with MathML in
the latter.

===== &lt;jose.i.rojas@gmail.com&gt;

I've been doing this for about a year now.  I use the math docutils 
directive.  A custom .XCompose file (for example: 
https://github.com/kragen/xcompose)  also helps.

===== Terry

I think math was added to docutils after I started using itex2mml,
neater to use docutils built in math now I think.

Although having said that, playing with docutils math a bit suggests
itex2mml gives more complete support for both MathMML and perhaps LaTeX
math (with the PDF target).

===== jose

Terry, your setup is probably more flexible, but I haven't had any problems with 
docutils math. It seems to support all the syntax that I've found necessary.

I forgot to mention that the viewrendered plug-in doesn't display math 
correctly.  I'm not sure what the problem is, I remember trying to figure 
it out a while back, but I never got anywhere.  It's not really a big 
problem though, I have scripts to compile nodes to html/pdfs and open them 
in firefox/pdf reader; math works fine that way.

===== From: offray@riseup.net

Is not properly Leo, but is python related, tailored for math and with a
web interface and has leo bindings, check Ipython:

http://ipython.org/

I'm using it for all my math related writing and I think that point the
future of interactive writing in Python. I dream of a body pane on leo
with the features of the pyton qt console.

The following is a first draft of a unit-testing tutorial.  It will form 
the basis of a new help-for-unit-testing command, and may also become the 
introduction to Leo unit-testing chapter.

All comments are welcome.  Please let me know if anything is unclear.

-----

Leo makes it easy to create and run unit tests from individual outline 
nodes or trees.

A node whose headline starts with @tests defines a unit test.

The body text of the @test node contains a **self-contained** unit test.

For example, this creates a complete unit test::

    @test fails  (headline)
    assert False (body text)

To run this test, select the @test node and do:
&lt;alt-x&gt;run-selected-unit-tests-locally.
Leo will create and run the unit test automatically.

To see all of Leo's unit testing commands, do:
&lt;alt-x&gt;run&lt;tab&gt;

Leo pre-defines 'c', 'g' and 'p' in unit tests just as in scripts.

For more details about unit testing, see: 
http://leoeditor.com/unitTesting.html

**Notes for Leo developers**

leo/test/unitTest.leo contains all of Leo's own unit tests.

Running all tests is not necessary.  Just select::

    Active Unit Tests

and then do Alt-4 (run-selected-unit-tests-locally).

**Note**: Some tests will likely fail on machines other than EKR's.
You only need to be concerned about unit tests that start failing after you 
make your changes.

I know a programming IDE
&lt;http://sourceforge.net/projects/doublesvsoop/&gt;which bases its existence in
that concept:

You write "code Masks" and whenever you call a piece of code it will ask
only for the parameters, and write the rest of the code. There are already
some languages with most of the masks (all the primary functions and some
complex ones) and its growing.

For instance, if you write:

"window" it will add the window to the code and let you edit the params.

Their functionality would be awesome in Leo and when I know a bit better I
will try to emulate on it. Sticking to Leo tho since it has a much superior
way of managing data.

I suspect different people have different things in mind when they talk
about templates.

Leo's abbreviation system is already quite advanced when it comes to
filling in skeletons of common code layouts.  I type

  def;;

and I get

  def foo(this, that=3D3):
      """foo - Return
 
      :Parameters:
      - `this`: &lt;|describe this|&gt;
      - `that`: &lt;|describe that|&gt;
      """
 
      &lt;|code|&gt;

Two "parameters" are interactively requested, the function name, and
the list of arguments.  The node name is presented as the default for
the function name, and 'self' is included in the list of arguments, so,
assuming the node was already called 'foo', all I type is this, that=3D3.
The layout above is the rst form of the epydoc/sphinx docstring with
formally identified parameters.

The cursor is positioned after Return, where the was an empty &lt;||&gt;
placeholder.  Pressing ,, selects the next placeholder so that typing
replaces it.

There's more, see
https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=3D#!topic/leo-editor/5ni2PwfmBz8
and the screencast linked from there
http://www.greygreen.org/tmp/leoabbrev.ogv

Other people, Jacob etc. I think, have been talking about templates
where the input parameters are stored in the outline, allowing for
some of them to be altered and the template generation step re-run.
More like generating a website from data etc.</t>

Hi.

As I use Leo to write PL/SQL code, I need to write similar text several
times, changing only small parts of it. It would be great if I could create
a node with the "template" and then clone it everywhere it should be
written, and then providing the parameters to be used in this writing.

Let me try to clarify it. I'd like to create a tree like this:

 +- @file something.sql
           +- Section 1
              + &lt;&lt; Clone &gt;&gt; with Parameters A, B
           +- Section 2
              + &lt;&lt; Clone &gt;&gt; with Parameters C, D

In this tree, both "Clone" nodes would be generated from a template
specified somewhere in the tree, and would have parts of its text replaced
with values "A" and "B" in Section 1, and "C" and "D" in Section 2.

I've searched but couldn't find anything like this, then I've thought of
trying to write a hook to intercept the "save" command, but couldn't think
of a way to pass the parameters; I think the obvious way would be to put
the parameters after the "&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;", but then all cloned nodes are changed, so
it wouldn't work.

Another alternative would be creating some kind of directive @something,
but I have no idea of how to do that.

Any ideas?

&gt; Other people, Jacob etc. I think, have been talking about templates

I've tried it and it's great, I think it will be useful, but it's not what
I was thinking of...

Let me try to explain what I had tougth about... What I would like to do is:

 1. create a new .leo file
 2. add a "template" node (eventually with sub nodes) with some ${schema}
and ${table} macro place holders in its contents
 3. add a @file node to the .leo file
 4. add to this @file node a new one with definitions such as
schema=3DSCHEMA_NAME and table=3DTABLE_NAME
 5. add as a sub node to this last one a clone from the "template" node;
 6. then, when I save everything, the @file would have "SCHEMA_NAME" and
"TABLE_NAME" everywhere a "${schema}" or a "${table}" were in the original
template node.

It would be important that, when I reopen the .leo file later, the macros
in the @file node where shown as ${schema} and ${table}, and not as it's
substituted text.

Now that I've described it, I can't see how it would be done... The
${macro} place holders should be on the contents of the @file node, so
after substitution, how could we recover it?

That's also why the code from Jacob is not what I need (but I'm already
thinking of other uses for it :) ): it will create a text when the button
is pressed, but the generated nodes will be just static text.

Hello,
I recently discovered Leo in my search for an editor or IDE for python 
programming -- I'm a beginner but am working on a larger project and trying 
out a modular approach requiring organisation of lots of files. Leo would 
be an attractive option if not for various obstacles, including among 
others the following:

  1. Doesn't automatically open previously loaded workbooks, or by file 
click
     * Even when file directly clicked, doesn't open.
     * Only opens from File menu. Annoying &amp; inconvenient. 
  2. Same file as node opened in notepad then edited while still open in 
Leo doesn't update, even on refresh.
  3. Does not open python files in Idle with selection of menu item: File 
--&gt; Open With --&gt; Idle
  
I'm on Windows 8. I've already spent several hours solving other problems 
and reading Leo documentation. Any links or tips to overcome these problems 
quickly would be appreciated.

Sheng.

&gt;

You must set the file association manually, at present.  Getting this to
happen automatically is a top priority.

Hmm.  It seems like setting file associations isn't documented anywhere.
That's a major hole.

We are currently discussing this topic in this thread:
Bat file launchers for nightly builds:
https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/leo-editor/li9ILUWuNAs
Anyone want to summarize the results?

  2. Same file as node opened in notepad then edited while still open in
&gt; Leo doesn't update, even on refresh.
&gt;

The vim and xemacs plugins do an automatic refresh.  It won't be possible
to update Leo automagically from scite until you save the file in site.
This could be called a bug: please feel free to file a bug report.


&gt;   3. Does not open python files in Idle with selection of menu item: File
&gt; --&gt; Open With --&gt; Idle
&gt;

OpenWith:Idle opens a Leo *node*, not a file.  However, you could use @edit
to put an entire file into a node, and then open the @edit node with Idle.

I personally never use Idle, which is probably why OpenWith:Idle isn't very
useful.  Instead, I use g.pdb.

Thanks for your comments.  Please feel free to continue this conversation.

- Im having trouble also linking Leo files to Leo. I have tried this:
  

      Associate .leo filetype batch file:
&gt;           ftype LeoFile=3DC:Python25pythonw.exe =93C:Python25Libsite-
&gt; packagesleolaunchLeo.py=94 =93%1=94 assoc .leo=3DLeoFile

Which I found here&lt;https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=3D#!searchin/leo-editor/associate/leo-editor/3Ry5o8gE16E/Ble8B8RCRUsJ&gt;,
but leolaunchleo.py doesnt even exist anymore (the post is old).

- I guess others have had this idea but It would be great to include a
  small file within the Quickstart guide which would associate files
  automatically. (Or maybe asking for imput, which can be done through a
  Leo node and this way the user learns about its functionality).

- Also, I miss some more buttons or scripts in quick start guide,
  preferably before the "programming" section, so when a new user opens it,
  he has had the opportunity to do Ctrl+B on several scripts (for instance,
  showing in the log the name of all the nodes within the selected one,
  having some subnodes with numbers and doing math on them and showing the
  result on the log pane, and as much "silly" but visual functions as
  possible so the user, by going pressing ctrl+b on each, gets a bigger
  chance to understand what is Leo. In my oppinion some users will just
  stop in the quickguide if they are not presented with such a thing before
  going to docs.leo etc.

- Another thing is the plugin activation, the description of the plugins is
  not as accessible as it should be (opinions here, focusing in new users,
  and as I always say, appreciating and fully grateful for Leo as is
  now),and a script for activating them easier, been a week using Leo and
  still cant quite activate, find the descriptions or use them freely...
  And if each plugin or script had an example of use that would be
  priceless, for instance, including them all in quickstart (both scripts,
  plugins branchs) and then the new user could just go through all clicking
  on the examples and just seeing Leo work and show its potential. I know
  some of those are done but as I said, after a week or so I still am very
  confused...

- Also, quickstartguide should be open by default (instead of current Leo
  workbook) at least until the user changes some config and prevents that
  from happening. Is there any "load previous tabs" functionality? (IE open
  the Leo files which where open when it was closed the last time)

I've added a new plugin to Leo, that adds printing support when using 
the Qt GUI.  Available from rev 5779.

Here's the docscring:

'''Supports printing from the Qt GUI.

Jacob M. Peck, 2013

Commands
=======
This plugin supports the following twelve commands:

print-selected-node
-------------------

Opens up the print dialog to print the selected headline and node.

print-preview-selected-node
---------------------------

Opens up the print preview dialog to preview the selected headline
and node.

print-selected-node-body
------------------------

Opens up the print dialog to print the selected node body.

print-preview-selected-node-body
--------------------------------

Opens up the print preview dialog to preview the selected node body.

print-expanded-node
-------------------

Opens up the print dialog to print the expanded contents of the
selected node, with top-level headline.

print-preview-expanded-node
---------------------------

Opens up the print preview dialog to preview the expanded contents
of theselected node, with top-level headline.

print-expanded-node-body
------------------------

Opens up the print dialog to print the expanded node body.

print-preview-expanded-node-body
--------------------------------

Opens up the print preview dialog to preview the expanded node
body.

print-marked-nodes
------------------

Opens up the print dialog to print all marked nodes in the current
outline, with headlines.

print-preview-marked-nodes
--------------------------

Opens up the print preview dialog to preview all marked nodes in \\
the current outline, with headlines.

print-marked-node-bodies
------------------------

Opens up the print dialog to print the bodies of all marked nodes
in the current outline.

print-preview-marked-node-bodies
--------------------------------

Opens up the print preview dialog to preview the bodies of all
marked nodes in the current outline.

Settings
=======
- ``@string printing-font-family = DejaVu Sans Mono``
   The font family for printing.  A monospaced font is recommended.

- ``@string printing-font-size = 12``
   The font size for printing bodies, in px.  Due to limitations
   of PyQt, the size of headlines cannot be changed.
'''

To use it, be sure to add `printing.py` to your @enabled-plugins.

Future work may have more printing modes available, and I intend on 
doing a blog post on the leoblog about creating custom printing modes in 
scripts.

I agree completely w/r/t 'list-&lt;attribute&gt;', but it most likely is too 
late.  Those are probably in use by some script somewhere.  :(

Thanks for the comments, though!  To be fair, this whole thing was crazy 
simple to throw together - Qt does *all* the heavy lifting. Just throw 
together an HTML string, wrap it in a QTextDocument, and call print_, 
and Bob's your uncle.  I can see why Leo uses PyQt now... it's awesome.

So, in the search results, will I be able to know how to call that function?
IE, if I find insertIconFromFile, will I be able to know that I can call it

&gt;
&gt; It occurs to me that the same code could be used to search Leo's

&gt;

I suppose you could say that there is no general solution, but the
situation isn't really all that difficult.

Start with c.  We know what that is:  it is a commander object representing
an open outline.

There are **official ivars** of c, all referring to wrapper classes defined
in leoFrame.py:

c.frame: an instance of leoFrame.
c.frame.tree: an instance of  leoTree.
c.frame.body: an instance of leoBody.
c.frame.log: an instance of leoLog.

The tree, body and log objects have a *ctrl* objects, which are *wrapper*
classes:

c.frame.tree.treeCtrl
c.frame.body.bodyCtrl
c.frame.log.logCtrl

In particular, see
http://leoeditor.com/scripting.html#c-frame-body-bodyctrlfor a
description of the high-level text interface supported by all
high-level text widgets, including the log and body classes.

These wrapper classes have a widget ivar, which is a reference to the
corresponding Qt widget object.  For example::

    import PyQt4.QtGui as QtGui
    w =3D c.frame.body.bodyCtrl.widget
    g.es(w)
    g.es(isinstance(w,QtGui.QTextBrowser)

yields::

    (LeoQTextBrowser) 62418136
    True

As shown, the LeoQTextBrowser class is a real (subclass of) QTextBrowser.

HTH.  I've made a note to discuss official ivars in more detail in the
scripting chapter.

I'm not aware of a general solution to the problem of finding the
various pieces of Leo's class structure.  Basically there are all these
classes defined in the source, and instances of these are attached to
each other in a hierarchical network (with loops).

I've written an introspection function which lists the methods and
instance variables (and class variables) of an arbitrary object by name
and by type.  I should release it.  It builds its lists in a Leo
outline, so you can navigate around that outline and expand nodes by
introspection as needed.

It occurs to me that the same code could be used to search Leo's
runtime object hierarchy for you, i.e. you enter 'insertIconFromFile'
and it recursively searches for it.

Cheers -Terry

I didn't really finish the above para.  The problem is that it's hard
to guess what the names of the attachment points are, and the attaching
is done in a variety of places, sometimes by factory functions which
further obscure linkages.  Not a fault with Leo, just the way programs
work.  So the tool I've written may be the best approach to mapping
Leo's runtime structure. Another thing it could do, try and map 'major'
classes, or at least classes from leo.core.* - i.e. ignore the built in
types.</t>

I've added an abbreviation to my myLeoSettings.leo abbreviations:
https://gist.github.com/tbnorth/5530059

It's the abbreviation "persist;;" and when you type that you get:

---cut here---
import json

json_state_file = "cache_info_file.json"
if not os.path.exists(json_state_file):
    json.dump({'cache_items':{}}, open(json_state_file, 'w'))
cache_info = json.load(open(json_state_file))

def main():

    # do stuff with cache_info...

if __name__ == '__main__':

    try:
        main()
    except:
        json.dump(cache_info, open(json_state_file, 'w'))
---cut here---

with appropriate interaction to customize all the parts which, in the
above example, include "cache_", i.e. the filename and the variable
name.

The point is it seems silly to create a module and hence a dependency
for what is barely 4 lines of actual code, but those 4 lines give you
very handy robust persistence, so something like an editor abbreviation
is the obvious way to make the available - nothing Leo specific here,
except that only serious editors have abbreviation like that ;-).

The corrected version is below for reference - I had `except` instead
of `finally` in the first version, so you data was only saved if
something went wrong :-)

It's just a framework for providing a dictionary the contents of which
persist between runs of the program.  I've used it for code that's
making lots of small url requests against a server, to cache the
results so that during development the crash / debug / re-run cycle is

every run.  More recently I was using it to store key value pairs of
filenames and a comment on the issue in the file, knowing that

one run of the program which was identifying the issues.

So in the example below, the content of the cache_info dictionary is
persistent, whatever main() does with it is seen next time the
program's run.  Nothing Leo specific except that it's really just an
import statement plus 5 lines of code and doesn't seem worth its own
file, but is more than you want to re-type all the time either, so
ideal for an abbreviation in your favorite editor.

I've added a couple of comments in the version below.

A **position** object represents a specific node in a Leo outline.

Equivalently, a position represents the state of a Leo generator, that is,
a specific node during a traversal of a Leo outline.

Because of clones, a node may appear arbitrarily many times in an outline,
so a node may appear at arbitrarily many positions in the outline.

For any position p, **p.v** is the vnode at position p.

A node's vnode never changes, regardless of where the node appears in the
outline, and regardless of whether the node is cloned or not.

**Positions become invalid when the outline changes.**

You may save and and use positions *provided* the outline remains unchanged.

Leo's generators deliver positions, one after each other, using a *single*
(ever-changing) position. As a result, scripts must use p.copy() to create
lists of positions. For example::

    aList = [p.copy() for p in c.rootPosition().subtree()]
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20130803125244.17093">Consider this example, where nodes with the same names are clones of each other::

+ Root
    + A
        - B
    + A
        - B
    - B

Leo's c.all_nodes() iterator will deliver 9 positions:

    1: Root
    2: A
    3: B
    4: A
    5: B
    6: B

*All* positions returned by a traversal are distinct.  Some examples:

- Position 2: A is different from position 4: A
  The former is the first child of root; the latter is the second child of root.
  
- The parent of position 3: B is A at childIndex 0 of Root.
  The parent of position 5: B is A at childIndex 1 of Root.
  The parent of position 6: B is Root. The childIndex of 6: B is 2.

The first placeholder, ``&lt;|return|&gt;`` will be selected, so you can
begin typing in the right place. Hitting ``,,`` will select the next
place holder, and so on.

Here's a list of `@settings` which relate to abbreviations.

@bool enable-abbreviations = False
    True: enable abbreviations
    False disable abbreviations
    
    Typically you would enable abbreviations in myLeoSettings.leo or in individual
    .leo files.
@data global-abbreviations &amp; @data abbreviations
    # Comments lines (lines starting with '#') are ignored.
    # Non-comment lines should have the form::
    #
    #    name=definition
    
    # Definitions in @data abbreviation nodes override definitions in @data
    # global-abbreviation nodes. Typically you would define @data abbreviation nodes
    # in myLeoSettings.leo
@string abbreviations-subst-start = None
    If this @string is set to something other than None, *and*
    @bool scripting-at-script-nodes = True, then substitutions
    will be made when abbreviations are inserted.  For example
    set abbreviations-subst-start to ``{|{`` and
    abbreviations-subst-end to ``}|}`` and an abbreviation
    like::
    
        date;;={|{import time;x=time.asctime()}|}
    
    will expand to something like "Mon Aug 20 22:00:40 2012"
    
    See also abbreviations-subst-env.
@string abbreviations-subst-end = }|}
    See abbreviations-subst-start.  This setting,
    abbreviations-subst-end, has no effect if
    abbreviations-subst-start is not set.
@data abbreviations-subst-env
    If abbreviations-subst-start is set (see that 
    @setting), the code in this node will be executed, once
    only, when the outline is loaded, in an environment which
    will be used for execution of substitutions in
    abbreviations.  For example, if this node contains
    ``import time``, then an abbreviation like::
    
        date;;={|{import time;x=time.asctime()}|}
    
    can be written more simply as::
    
        date;;={|{x=time.asctime()}|}
    
    The environment will contain `c` and `g`, a dict called `_values`
    (see ask() and get() in @data abbreviations-subst-env), and
    `_abr`, the abbreviation being expanded.
    
    Start lines with `\:` to preserve indentation.
@@data abbreviations examples
    See the node for examples of advanced abbreviations with
    substitutions.
@string abbreviations-place-start = &lt;|
    Start of a placeholder for template expansions.  E.g.

        w;;=while &lt;|condition|&gt;:
        \:    &lt;|code|&gt;
    
    This would expand with the `&lt;|condition|&gt;` selected, and `,,`,
    if that's an abbreviation linked to next_place(), see 
    @@data abbreviations examples, would select `&lt;|code|&gt;`.
@string abbreviations-place-end = \|&gt;
    The end of a placeholder for template expansions, e.g.
