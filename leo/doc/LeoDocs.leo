<t tx="EKR.20040518070558">Leo 4.2 alpha 2           May 18, 2004

This is an important milestone in Leo's history; the two defining features of the 4.2 code base are complete:

1. This is the first stable version using the "shared nodes" code base.

Shared nodes dramatically improve the time needed to insert, delete, and move nodes.  Moreover, the new code base is code compatible with the old.  Indeed, much of Leo still uses the old code base.  See Chapter 7 for full details of how to script Leo with the 4.2 code base.

2. This is the first version to use @file-thin for most derived files.

@file-thin makes it possible to use Leo effectively in a cvs environment.  Indeed, cvs now contains only a "dummy" version of LeoPy.leo.  The idea is that:

- LeoPyRef.leo hardly ever changes.  Developers will download LeoPyRef.leo once from cvs, then rename LeoPyRef.leo to be LeoPy.leo.  LeoPy.leo is private to each developer.

- Developers will commit and update to cvs only thin derived files.  There is no longer any need to keep .leo files and the files derived from them "in synch".

- Similar remarks apply to LeoPlugins.leo.  Cvs contains only LeoPluginsRef.leo, and contributors will need only to submit thin derived files.

I have been using the new code base without incident for weeks now, and I am fairly confident that it is safe to use.  Nevertheless, I would suggest routine caution when dealing with this version until more people have tested it.

Known bugs

- Cutting and pasting an @file-thin node does not work properly.  This will be easy to fix, I think.

- The present algorithm for reading thin derived files probably does not handle properly the situation in which a named node is some kind of grand child of the referencing node rather than being an immediate child of the referencing node.  This is a rare situation, easily avoided, and it doesn't happen at all in LeoPy.leo.  Nevertheless, something must be done.

Other improvements:

- Fixed a number of problems with using Leo on MacOS X.  In particular, Leo now uses the clover key as is usual on the Mac.  More Mac and *nix specific improvements are coming.

Still to do:

- Perfect import and @import.
- Make the Go To Line Number command work with @file-thin files.
- Fix minor bugs and add new features
  See the "To Do: 4.2" node in the leoToDo.txt node in LeoPy.leo.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040518070824"></t>
<t tx="EKR.20040518070824.1">- Moved call to assignFileIndices into write_Leo_file.
- Called assignFileIndices in writeAtFileNodes, writeDirtyAtFileNodes, writeMissingAtFileNodes</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040518070940"></t>
<t tx="EKR.20040518070940.5">What I did:

File format

Added -thin field to @+leo sentinel

Recognizers

- Added vnode recognizers for @file-thin option.
- Added position proxies for vnode recognizers.

Directives &amp; sentinels
- Added support for @all.

Writing

- Added top-level atFile code to write @file-thin tree.
- DO write @file-thin vnodes if there was an error writing the derived file.
	- No autosave for @file-thin.
 	- Leo writes @file nodes first, so this is not a problem.
	- putVnode checks orphan bit, which gets set if there was an error.
- Don't write vnodes (or related tnodes) for @file-thin trees. (fileCommands).
- Do write empty nodes in @thin trees.
- Don't generate close node sentinels until all children have been generated.

Reading

- Set at.thinFile when reading thin files.
- Suppressed changed message and related items for thin files.
- Modified scanText4 and allies to read thin derived files.
	- Don't look for tnodeList for thin files.
	- Initially, at.lastThinNode is at.root.v
	- readStartNode calls createThinChild
	- createThinChild makes a child of at.lastThinNode if needed and sets at.lastThinNode.
- Updated fc.tnodesDict in at.createThinChild.
	Otherwise clones existing only in two thin files won't be linked properly.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040518070940.156">After a match, the find-next command searched only in the suboutline where the first match occurred.
To fix this, we call g.app.findFrame.handleUserClick in various Tk event handlers.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040518070940.164">@nocolor


p.v.t.visitedBit was used for two purposes:

- To mark the nodes to be written.
- To mark nodes that are not orphan.

What I did:

- Added t.is/set/clearWriteBit.
- Call t.setWriteBit in putVnode unless we are in a thin node.
- putTnodes tests for t.writeBit rather than t.visitedBit.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040518071415">Leo did not handle moving a node to the root position of the outline correctly.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040518075457">Using @ignore with @file-thin is asking for trouble.
If you remove the @ignore and then save, you will lose data.

How to recover the data:
	- Read Outline.
	- Remove @ignore
	- Import derived file... </t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.48">Leo supports unlimited undo for all typing and all commands. The
'undo_granularity' setting controls the granularity of undo. There are four
possible values:

``node``
    Starts a new undo unit when typing moves to a new node.

``line`` (default)
    Starts a new undo unit when typing moves to new line.

``word``
    Starts a new undo unit when typing starts a new word.

``char`` (not recommended)
    Starts a new undo unit for each character typed.
    This wastes lots of computer memory.

``setUndoTypingParams`` calls ``recognizeStartOfTypingWord`` to recognize the
start of words. Plugins can modify ``recognizeStartOfTypingWord``. It should
return ``True`` if the typing indicated by the params starts a new 'word' for the
purposes of undo with 'word' granularity. ``setUndoTypingParams`` calls this
method only when the typing could possibly continue a previous word. In other
words, undo will work safely regardless of the value returned. See the actual
code for ``recognizeStartOfTypingWord`` for more details.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.92">An @asis tree is a tree whose root headline starts with @asis &lt;filename&gt;.  Similarly, for @noref and @nosent trees.

New in 4.2:  The following terms are equivalent.  The first form is preferred in each case.

@asis, @file-asis, @silent
@nosent, @file-nosent and @nosentinelsfile
@noref, @file-noref and @rawfile

You can get any combination of sentinels/no sentinels and references/no references using @file, @nosent, @noref and @asis trees:

                 Derived files        Sections and 
Type of tree   contain sentinels?   @others expanded?
------------   ------------------   -----------------
       @asis   no                   no
       @file   yes                  yes
      @noref   yes                  no
     @nosent   no                   yes
     
       

Leo can not update the outline from changes made from derived files unless those files contain sentinels.  The primary source for @nosent and @asis trees are the outlines from which those files were derived.

Leo creates files derived from @noref and @asis trees by writing the body text of all nodes of the tree in outline order.  Leo writes the body text _as is_, without recognizing section definitions, without expanding section references, and without treating directives specially in any way.  In particular, Leo copies all directives, including @space or @c directives, to the derived file as text. However, Leo recognizes the @ignore directive in the _ancestors_ of @noref or @asis nodes, so you may use the @ignore directive as usual to prevent Leo from writing @rawfile and @silentfile trees.

Notes:

1. When writing @noref trees, Leo writes only the @+leo, @-leo, @+node, @-node, @+body and @-body sentinels.

2. Within @asis trees only, if a headline starts with @@, Leo writes everything in the headline following the @@ just before the corresponding body text.

3. Files derived from @asis trees contain _nothing_ not contained in body text (or @@ headlines).  In particular, if body text does not end in a newline, the first line from the next node will concatenated to the last line of the preceding node.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.242">Leo reads and writes "foreign" attributes in ``&lt;v&gt;`` and ``&lt;t&gt;`` elements in .leo files as follows:

- When reading a .leo file, Leo will create ``t.unknownAttributes`` or ``v.unknownAttributes`` ivars for
  any ``tnode`` or ``vnode`` whose corresponding ``&lt;v&gt;`` or ``&lt;t&gt;`` element in the .leo file contains a foreign attribute.

- The ``unknownAttributes`` ivars are dictionaries whose keys are the attribute names and whose values are strings.

- When writing a file, Leo will write "foreign" attributes if a ``vnode`` or ``tnode`` contains an ``unknownAttributes`` ivar.

- The only native attribute of ``&lt;t&gt;`` elements is ``tx``.

- The native attributes of ``&lt;v&gt;`` elements are ``a``, ``t``, ``vtag`` and ``tnodeList``.

- The native attributes of ``&lt;v&gt;`` elements are ``marks``, ``expanded`` and ``descendentTnodeUnknownAttributes``.

- Non-native attributes are called **foreign** attributes.

- Leo performs the usual xml escapes on these strings when reading or writing the ``unknownAttributes`` ivars.

Plugins may cause Leo to write such foreign attributes simply by attaching unknownAttributes ivars to a vnode or tnode.
Like this::

	if hasattr(v,"unknownAttributes"):
		v.unknownAttributes ["vnodeIcon"] = pathToIcon
	else:
		v.unknownAttributes = {"vnodeIcon" : pathToIcon}

See the section called "Recommended conventions for plugins" for advice about
how to avoid potential conflicts in naming new attributes.

All members of these dictionaries should be "pickleable". That is, Leo uses
Python's Pickle module to encode all values in these dictionaries. Leo will
discard any attributes that can not be pickled. This should not be a major
problem to plugins. For example, instead of putting a tnode into these
dictionaries, a plugin could put the tnode's gnx (a string) in the dictionary.

Leo writes only ``t.unknownAttributes`` when writing ``@thin`` trees to the .leo
file. Leo puts (the encoding of) these elements into an attribute called
``descendentTnodeUnknownAttributes``. This attribute is part of the ``&lt;v&gt;``
element representing the ``@thin`` node. Leo does _not_ write
``v.unknownAttributes`` in ``@thin`` trees because *only tnodes have gnx's in
thin derived files*. In effect, vnodes are anonymous. We could attempt to get
around this by identifying vnodes by their corresponding tnodes, but that's not
a general solution and it is, in effect, equivalent to writing only
``t.unknownAttributes``. So it seems pointless to "pretend" to be writing
``v.unknownAttributes``.

The effect of this is to make all vnodes identical, as far as using
unknownAttributes is concerned. This won't work in all cases. For example, a
plugin that creates an arbitrary directed graph between vnodes must distinguish
between joined vnodes. In that case, the plugin should confine itself to @file
trees, or just vnodes in .leo files, for that matter.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040601084317">Leo 4.2 alpha 3           June 1, 2004

This version fixes completes the essential features of version 4.2.  All known incompletions and bugs involving shared nodes and Leo's new file format have been fixed.  BTW, this version of Leo completes Leaps 201 and 202.

It should be safe to use this version for collaboration between Leo's developers.  I hereby encourage people to start using cvs for collaboration.  Only by doing so will we discover any possible problems.

The only item that must be completed before releasing 4.2 beta is fixing the Go To Line Number command so it supports thin derived files.

There are many known bugs in this version: most are minor bugs that have been around for a long time.  All known bugs will be fixed by the first release candidate.  See the to-do list in LeoPy.leo for the complete list.

The highlights of this version:

- All features of @file-thin are now complete and appear to be stable.
	- All .leo files in the distribution use @thin files where possible.
	- Leo ignores all directives within the range of the @all directive.
	- The @+middle and @-middle sentinels allow sections to be defined in any descendant node.
	- The @clone sentinel marks duplicate cloned siblings.
- The beginnings of a new undo scheme are in place.
- @thin, @nosent, @noref and @asis are abbreviations for @file-thin, @file-nosent, @file-noref and @file-asis.
- Created new iterators that return lists of vnodes and tnodes, including iterators that remove all duplicates from those lists.</t>

Leo 4.2 beta 1           June 30, 2004

The highlights of 4.2 beta 2:

- Leo now writes the entire contents of @ignore'd @thin trees to the .leo file.
This change ensures that users can create and remove @ignore directives without
any chance of losing data inadvertently.

- Leo now saves and restores marks and the expansion state of nodes in @thin trees.

- Leo marks @thin nodes as dirty whenever they become "newly unignored", i.e.,
when an @thin node no longer falls in the range of an @ignore directive.

Beta 1 completes all fundamental work in the 4.2 code base. All essential code
is complete. Dozens of bugs have been fixed since the Alpha 3 release about a
month ago.

Known bugs in 4.2 beta 2:

- Not all plugins work correctly.
- Some plugins leak memory very slightly.

The highlights of Leo 4.2:

- @thin trees make Leo much more friendly to cvs. Files derived from @thin can
be committed to cvs and updated from cvs without having to commit or update the
corresponding .leo file. There is no longer any need to keep .leo files and
derived files in synch.

- Leo's data structures have been reorganized. As a result, all outline
operations are much faster. To support this organization, scripts that traverse
Leo's data structures must now use a positions rather than vnodes. Old scripts
that appear to use vnodes will still work because methods like c.currentVnode
that appear to return vnodes actually return positions.

Other features of 4.2:

- Leo is now much more friendly to using spaces instead of tabs.
- The Execute Script command reports erroneous lines more clearly.
- The usual assortment of bug features and minor features.

Coming soon in 4.2:

- Perfect Import will guarantee that Leo imports file perfectly.
- @import will allow you to study files using Leo without changing those files.</t>

- Leo calls g.enableIdleTimeHook at end of startup code.
	- This means that g.idleTimeHookHandler gets called periodically, even if no hooks have been defined.
	- g.enableIdleTime hook now calls g.app.gui.setIdleTimeHook at most once.

- app.forceShutdown now calls "end1" hook before calling app.finishQuit.
	- This ensures that the "end1" hook always gets called once.
	- app.finishQuit calls doHook("end1",...) only if it hasn't been called before.
		- This isn't necessary, but it makes traces in doHook less confusing.

- idleTimeHookHandler now calls the idle-time hook for all open windows.
	- So having multiple windows open should not affect idle-time hooks.

** Warning: new convention required to workaround apparent Tk problems.
	- "idle" hooks should return if g.app.killed is True.</t>

What I did:

- putDirective and readDirective now check for @langauge and @comment, and change comment delims appropriately.

This is slightly dubious: after all, an @langauge directive in the middle of most derived files will cause havoc.  However, one could say that this is the users problem :-)

BTW, this doesn't really solve all problems in @all trees: Leo can still get mightily confused about comment delims if the user doesn't put proper @language directives in @all trees.

*** Alpha quality code:  Please make full backups before playing with this code!

This release marks another significant milestone in Leo's history:

- Leo's 4.x file code is complete.  At present I have no plans to change the format of .leo files or derived files.  I am eating my own dog food: I do all my editing with the 4.1 code base.

- Leo uses immutable gnx's (id:timestamp:n) by default to associate tnodes with vnodes in .leo files.  This makes Leo as cvs friendly as possible.  From now on .leo files will be checked in to cvs with the -ko (text/keywords off) option.

- The use_gnx setting in leoConfig.txt determines whether uses gnx's (cvs friendly) or ints.  No version of Leo before 4.1 can read .leo files containing gnx.   Only gnx's are immutable.  Leo recomputes all non-gnx indices from scratch whenever writing a .leo file. It is possible to convert between 3.x and 4.1 file formats by changing the use_gnx setting.

- The 4.1 code base has been reorganized to support gui's other than tkinter.  Leo's src directory contains several new source files.

- The file test.leo in the test directory contains real regression tests for syntax coloring.   Regression testing scripts create regression tests dynamically from data in Leo's outline.  Very cool, very easy, very general.  In particular, regression tests may use temporary nodes in test.leo rather than creating separate Tk windows for testing.

Known bugs:

- The Extract commands eat one character too much.

- The __wx_gui.py plugin is only partly functional.</t>

More than a year in the making, Leo 4.0 is finally here.

Highlights of 4.0 final:
-----------------------

** Improved and simplified format of derived files.
	- Eliminated child indices, extraneous blank lines and @body sentinels.
	- Eliminated @node sentinels that indicate outline structure.
	- New @nl and @nonl sentinels indicate where newlines are and aren't.
	- These changes will largely eliminate unwanted cvs conflicts.

** Greatly improved error handling.
	- Reading derived files _never_ alter outline structure or links.
	- Read errors leave the outline completely unchanged.
	- Broken clone links are gone forever.
	- As a result, 4.0 is much safer than all previous versions.

** Full compatibility will previous versions of Leo.
	- Leo 4.0 reads all derived files properly, regardless of version.
	- Leo writes new-format derived files by default, and this default may be changed.
	- New commands in the read/write menu allow you to explicitly specify the format of derived files.

* New commands:
	- Write 3.x Derived File and Write 4.x Derived File.
	- Import Derived File.
	- Clear Recent Files.

* Dozens of other improvements, including:
	- Better Unicode support.
	- New configuration settings.
	- Several new plugins.

This is the third public release of Leo 4.0. There are no known serious bugs in
this version of Leo.

Highlights of 4.0 beta 3
------------------------

- Fixed problems with setting Leo's window icons.
- Plugins may now save their own information in &lt;v&gt; and &lt;t&gt; elements in .leo files.
- The usual assortment of bug fixes and minor improvements.

<t tx="edream.110203163054.71">This was a long-standing bug.  It's effect was cosmetic, and it was important to fix.</t>

<t tx="edream.110203163054.76">Leo can now read and write "foreign" attributes in &lt;v&gt; and &lt;t&gt; elements in .leo files:

- When reading a .leo file, Leo will create t.unknownAttributes or v.unknownAttributes ivars for any tnode and vnode object whose corresponding &lt;v&gt; or &lt;t&gt; element in the .leo file contains a foreign attribute.

- The unknownAttributes ivars are a dictionary whose keys are the attribute names and whose values are strings.

- When writing a file, Leo will write "foreign" attributes if  a vnode or tnode contains an unknownAttributes ivar.

- The only "native" attributes that Leo expects to find are the "tx" attribute in &lt;t&gt; elements and the "a", "t", "vtag" and "tnodeList" attributes of &lt;v&gt; elements.  Everything else is a foreign attribute.

- Leo performs the usual xml escapes on these strings when reading or writing the unknownAttributes ivars.

Plugins may cause Leo to write such foreign attributes simply by attaching unknownAttributes ivars to a vnode or tnode.  For example:

	v.unknownAttributes = {"vnodeIcon" : pathToIcon}

It would be best not to delete other foreign attributes, so the following would be preferred:

	if hasattr(v,"unknownAttributes"):
		v.unknownAttributes["vnodeIcon"] = pathToIcon
	else:
		v.unknownAttributes = {"vnodeIcon" : pathToIcon}

Another way:

	try:
		v.unknownAttributes["vnodeIcon"] = pathToIcon
	except AttributeError:
		v.unknownAttributes = {"vnodeIcon" : pathToIcon}</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.77"></t>

This is the second public release of Leo 4.0. There are no known serious bugs
in this version of Leo. Version 4.0 is the culmination of over a year of
collaborative design work and several months of actual implementation.

Highlights of 4.0 beta 2
------------------------
* Fixed several bugs:
  - Fixed several problems with reading and writing 4.0 derived files.
  - Fixed several Unicode-related bugs.
  - Fixed a crasher in the Go To Line Number command.
  - Fixed a problem with Importing Python files.
* Important improvements:
  - Added allow_clone_drags setting.  N.B. Allows Leo to be used with Aqua.
  - When running Python 2.3 Leo can now create window icons without third-party packages.
- The usual minor improvements and bug fixes.

This is the first public release of Leo 4.0.  Version 4.0 is the culmination of over a year of collaborative design work and several months of actual implementation.

Please use caution when using this beta version of Leo.  It appears very solid and it has been tested by only a few people.

Highlights of 4.0:

** Improved and simplified format of derived files.
	- Eliminated child indices, extraneous blank lines and @body sentinels.
	- Eliminated @node sentinels that indicate outline structure.
	- New @nl and @nonl sentinels indicate where newlines are and aren't.
	- These changes will largely eliminate unwanted cvs conflicts.

** Greatly improved error handling.
	- Reading derived files _never_ alter outline structure or links.
	- Read errors leave the outline completely unchanged.
	- Broken clone links are gone forever.
	- As a result, using 4.0 is much safer than all previous versions.

** Full compatibility will previous versions of Leo.
	- Leo reads all derived files properly, regardless of version.
	- Leo writes new-format derived files by default, and this default may be changed.
	- New commands in the read/write menu allow you to explicitly specify the format of derived files.

* New commands:
	- Write 3.x Derived File.
	- Write 4.x Derived File.
	- Import Derived File.
	- Clear Recent Files.

- Several new plugins.
- Several minor bug fixes.

<t tx="edream.110203163054.100">The Synchronization Principle simplifies everything and at long last puts Leo on a firm theoretical foundation.  This principle states that the "smallest unit of meaning" of any Leo outline is the entire outline itself.  In particular, individual derived files have meaning only in the context of a particular outline.

The Synchronization Principle has the following happy consequences:

1. We may assume that all derived files are in synch with the outline that wrote them.  This assumption allows Leo to use "hidden machinery" in the outline to associate nodes in the derived file with nodes in the outline.  This "hidden" machinery consists of a list of tnodes associated with @file vnodes in the outline.  When writing a derived file Leo creates a list of tnodes in the order they were written to the derived file.  When reading the derived file, Leo uses this list to associate nodes in the derived file with nodes in the outline.

2. Derived files must get their structure from the .leo file that wrote them.  As we have seen, this is done using the hidden machinery in the .leo file.  Consequently, there is no further need to represent outline structure in derived files.  There is no need any longer either for child indices or for sentinels to represent outline structure.  As a result, we can eliminate @+body and @-body nodes entirely because all @+node sentinels are followed by body text.

3. All .leo files must contain full outline structure.  Even "thin" outline will contain the full representation of the outline as vnodes.

4. Reading _never_ alters outline structure in the outline.  No vnodes are ever created or destroyed and reading never alters clone links.  This is true whether or not read errors occur.  The read code sets a temporary attribute of tnodes while reading.  These attributes are copied to the permanent t.bodyString attribute only if no read errors were encountered.

4. Error recovery is now trivial:  Read errors indicate that the .leo files and one or more derived files are out-of-synch.  No error recovery is attempted: the @file tree in which the error occurred reverts back to its original state.

5. The new Import Derived File command is the _only_ way to recover data from mismatched derived file.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.101"></t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.102">The write_old_format_derived_files option in leoConfig.leo and leoConfig.txt determines which format of derived file Leo's Write and Save commands write by default.  If this option is 0 (recommended) Leo writes 4.x format derived files.  Otherwise Leo writes 3.x derived files.

Note that you can use the Write 3.x/4.x Derived Files commands in the File:Read/Write menu to write derived files in an explicitly specified format.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.103">This command deletes all entries in the Recent Files submenu except the most recent file.  The files themselves are not affected, just the menu entries.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.104">The Import Derived File command imports all the nodes in a derived file into the outline.  Unlike the read commands, no outline structure is preserved.  This command can import either 3.x or 4.x derived files.

This command is necessary in version 4.0 because there is no other way to read derived files that are out-of-synch with a .leo file.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.105">The Write 4.x Derived Files command and Write 3.x Derived Files command work just like the Write @file Nodes command, except that they write the indicated format off derived file.  In contrast, the Write @file Nodes command writes 3.x format derived files if and only if the write_old_format_derived_files = 1 in leoConfig.txt.

All three of these commands automatically save the outline (the .leo file) if any derived file was actually written.  This is necessary so that information in the .leo file always remains in synch with all derived files.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.106">Paul Paterson contributed the following new plugins:

mod_autosave.py

Autosaves the Leo document every so often.

mod_timestamp.py

Timestamps all save operations to show when they occur.

word_export.py

Exports an outline to a word document.  Clicking "plugins ... word export ... export" exports the selected outline to Word.  Word should be running with an open (empty) document before executing this command.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.107"></t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.108">Leo's read code now warns if any non-empty node is unvisited.  This check, and the check that headlines match pretty much guarantees that out-of-synch outlines will generate errors.  Thus, there is no need a gnx timestamp in @+leo sentinels!</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.109">Version 4.0 is a major advance in Leo's error handling.  Using 4.0 is much safer than all previous versions.  This new error handling applies to all derived files, both 3.x and 4.x format.  

Leo's read code never alters the structure of an outline, regardless of whether read errors are encountered. This means that clone links, marks, and all other information in the outline except body text remains completely unchanged during reads.  Broken clone links (the dreaded read errors) are gone forever.  
Also, the new read code makes no changes to any body text until it is known that no read errors have occurred.  This ensures that absolutely no changes at all are made to the outline if there are read errors.

Leo's read code now writes a message to the log pane whenever it sees that the body text in the derived file does not match the body text in the outline.  These messages do not indicate errors, only that the body text has been changed outside of Leo, say in an external editor or by cvs.</t>

<t tx="edream.110203163054.111"></t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.112">Added encoding comments to leoGlobals.py and French plugins

This removes a warning new in Python 2.3.
</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.113">There is no need to recycle Python objects when the last outline window is being closed.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.114">This is too annoying during testing.  The Read @file Nodes command will in fact be made undoable for the 4.0 final release.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.115">This has been changed in Python 2.3 and it probably wasn't ever a good idea...</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.116">The read code has much simplified using look-behind rather than look-ahead.  Both the read and write code write the file line-by-line without recursion.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.117"></t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.833">The Execute Script command executes body text as a Python script.  Leo execute the selected text, or the entire body text if no text is selected.

Scripts are executed in a "pristine" environment, that is, with __builtins__ as both the local and global environments.

New in version 4.1:  Body text may now contain @directives and section references. This is a major step forward: you can now use all of Leo's features to organize scripts that you execute interactively.

Section definitions must appear in the node containing the script or in descendant nodes.  Leo "preprocesses" all scripts by simulating the writing of a derived file to a string.

The Execute Script command sets app.scriptDict["script1"] to the value of the script before preprocessing, and sets app.scriptDict["script2"] to the value of the script after preprocessing.  Scripts may examine and change app.scriptDict as they please.</t>
<t tx="edream.110303182253.3">Leo does an auto-save only if something has actually been changed.</t>
<t tx="edream.110303182253.39"></t>
<t tx="edream.110303182719">The config_encoding setting controls the encoding of non-ascii characters in leoConfig.txt.

The use_gnx setting in leoConfig.txt determines whether uses gnx's (cvs friendly) or ints.  No version of Leo before 4.1 can read .leo files containing gnx.   Only gnx's are immutable.  Leo recomputes all non-gnx indices from scratch whenever writing a .leo file. It is possible to convert between 3.x and 4.1 file formats by changing the use_gnx setting.
</t>
<t tx="edream.110603185805">Leo 4.1 beta 5                   December 5, 2003

This is the fifth release of the reorganized 4.1 code base.

For the first time in months there are no serious bugs outstanding.

Warning: By default Leo 4.1 creates .leo files that can not be read by older versions of Leo.

Warning: Use the __wx_gui.py plugin with extreme caution until further notice:
bugs in this plugin could cause body text to be cleared improperly when changing nodes.

Beta 5:
  * Leo runs in batch mode when invoked with --script aScriptFile.py
    - Created "null gui" classes that do not use any gui code.
  * Leo supports Unicode characters (e.g. Chinese) in path and file names.
  * Fixed several long-standing bugs:
    - Fixed several minor problems with the Extract Section and Import commands.
    - Fixed problem that prevent the Find panel from working on the Mac.
    - Improved @url handling so that @url file:\\path\x.leo works properly.
    - Improved support for @lineending platform.
    - Leo honors outline/body pane ratio when opening .leo files.
    - Leo now ensures that newly-opened windows fit entirely on the screen.
    - Fixed a crasher when Undoing a Change All command when searching headlines.
  - Fixed other bugs resulting from the 4.1 reorg:
    - Fixed problem loading plugins on Linux.
    - Fixed crashers in the Extract Section and Extract commands.
    - Fixed a crasher when writing a file containing an undefined section.
    - Removed duplicate bindings in popup menus.
    - Made sure to show Leo's windows in wx gui plugin.

Beta 4:
  - Fixed several "reorg" bugs, some of which affected plugins.
  - Allow @directives and section references when executing scripts!
  - More than one section reference may now appear on the same line.
  - Use "utf-8" encoding for filenames under MacOS (Darwin)
  - Allow command or cmnd prefix for menu shortcuts under Darwin.
	  
Beta 3:
  - Completed the reorg, making many changes to the code base.
  - Fixed a LaTeX coloring bug

Beta 2:
  - Fixed a startup problem on Linux: the "mbcs" text encoding is not valid on Linux.

Beta 1:
  * Script-based find/change commands.
  - Hoist &amp; DeHoist commands for viewing parts of an outline.
  - Check Outline command finds user clone mistakes.
  * New configuration settings:
    - use_gnx specifies whether .leo files use integers as indices:
      use_gnx = 0 makes .leo files compatible with previous versions of Leo.
      use_gnx = 1 makes .leo files cvs-friendly
    - config_encoding specifies the encoding of leoConfig.txt.
  * Several significant code-level changes:
    - The 4.1 code base has been reorganized to support gui plugins.
    - An example wx_gui plugin is partly functional.
    - Created a flexible framework for creating &amp; running regression tests.
    - app.forceShutdown now works when called from plugins.</t>
<t tx="edream.110603190125.1">Leo 4.1 uses immutable gnx's (id:timestamp:n) by default to associate tnodes with vnodes in .leo files.  This makes Leo as cvs friendly as possible.  From now on .leo files will be checked in to cvs with the -ko (text/keywords off) option.</t>
<t tx="edream.110603190125.3">The file test.leo in the test directory contains real regression tests for syntax coloring.   Regression testing scripts create regression tests dynamically from data in Leo's outline.  Very cool, very easy, very general.  In particular, regression tests may use temporary nodes in test.leo rather than creating separate Tk windows for testing.</t>
<t tx="edream.110603190125.4">The 4.1 code base has been reorganized to support gui's other than tkinter.  Leo's src directory contains several new source files.

This reorg affects almost all plugins.  Considerably more work and testing will be done before 4.1 final.

The __wx_gui.py plugin is uses the newly reorganized code.  It is functional except for gui-dependent commands like Toggle-Split Direction.  WARNING: treat the this plugin with extreme caution until further notice.  The possibility exists that bugs in the code could cause body text to be cleared improperly when changing nodes.</t>
<t tx="edream.110603190234.1"></t>

<t tx="edream.110603190322.6">@nocolor

New in 4.1: Leo now supports scripts in Leo's Find/Change dialog.

Leo's find panel now contains the Script Search radio button and the Script
Change checkbox. When the Script Search radio button is selected Leo treats the
contents of the Search Text as a script to execute whenever any kind of Find
command is executed. Similarly, when the Script Change checkbox is selected Leo
treats the context of the Change Text as a script to execute whenever any kind
of Change command is executed. See below for just how this works.

Script-based find-change is extremely powerful. In effect, Leo's Find/Change
panel becomes a new platform for running scripts interactively. Leo now has all
the find/change capability of pattern matching languages like Snobol and Icon,
just by using the capabilities of the plain Python language. Moreover, Leo can
deliver these capabilities interactively or not depending which buttons you push
in Leo's Find/Change panel.

Script-based find/change frees the user from having to control script-based
searches interactively. Rather than forcing find/change scripts to implement
their own interactive controls, it is much easier to use what Leo already has.</t>
<t tx="edream.110603190322.8">Undoing Change All cleared the body pane or the headline pane.

The fix was simple: call setUndoParams instead of setUndoTypingParams in batchChange.</t>

<t tx="edream.110603190322.15">The Hoist command redraws the screen so presently selected tree becomes the only visible part of the outline.  Leo prevents the you from moving nodes outside the hoisted outline.  The De-hoist command restores the outline.  Hoist commands may be nested.</t>

<t tx="edream.111803060152"></t>
<t tx="edream.111803060152.1">Leo dedicates a Python dictionary called app.searchDict for communication
between Leo and the search and change scripts. The search and change scripts may
also use app.searchDict for communication between themselves. Leo sets
app.searchDict["type"] to "find", "change", "findAll" or "changeAll" to indicate
the kind of command being executed. Scripts may use all other entries in
app.searchDict as they please.

Leo executes the find script once when you press the Find button (or the Change
then Find button) in Leo's Find/Change dialog. Typically, the find script would
traversing the tree and highlight the found text or otherwise indicate to the
user that the find operation has succeeded. However, the script can do anything
it pleases.

Leo executes the the find script repeatedly when you press the Find All button.
Leo keeps executing the find script until app.searchDict["continue"] evaluates
to false. Initially there is no entry for app.searchDict["continue"], so the
find script must set app.searchDict["continue"] = true if it wants Leo to keep
executing it.

Leo executes the change script once when you press the Change button. Typically,
the change script would change the selected text. Usually the change script will
compute the new value of body text and call c.setBodyString(p,newText) to
make that change permanent. 

The change script also may handle undo, typically by calling
c.frame.onBodyChanged(v,"Change",oldText=oldText). Leo does not handle undo
automatically. Indeed, Leo makes no assumptions whatever about what the change
script really does.

Leo executes the the change script repeatedly when you press the Change All
button. Just as with the Find All command, Leo keeps executing the change script
until app.searchDict["continue"] evaluates to false.

Most find and change scripts will ignore settings in the Find Panel like "whole
word", "pattern match", and "reverse". However, these settings are available to
the scripts via ivars such as c.whole_word_flag, etc. if desired.</t>
<t tx="edream.111803060152.2">@nocolor

Some ideas for using scripts:
	
Either the find and change scripts may use Python's re module.  For
example, the find script could set app.searchDict["m"] to the match object
returned by re's match method.  The change script would then compute the
result, change the text and set the undo info as usual.

There is no reason to confine find/change scripts to operate on data only
within a Leo outline. These scripts could as easily traverse your file system
as the Leo outline. But notice: scripts could pull data from the file system
into the outline so that you can see the effects of changes as the scripts
operate. Again, this can all happen interactively if you like.</t>

@  New in version 4.1: On startup, Leo looks for two arguments of the form --script scriptFile.  If found, Leo enters batch mode.

In batch mode Leo does not show any windows.  Leo assumes the scriptFile contains a Python script and executes the contents of that file using Leo's Execute Script command.  By default, Leo sends all output to Leo's log pane to the console window.  Scripts in the scriptFile may disable or enable this output by calling app.log.disable() or app.log.enable()

Scripts in the scriptFile may execute any of Leo's commands except the Edit Body and Edit Headline commands.  Those commands require interaction with the user.

For example, the following batch script reads a Leo file and prints all the headlines in that file.
@c

import leoGlobals as g

path = r"c:\prog\leoCVS\leo\test\test.leo"

g.app.log.disable() # disable reading messages while opening the file
flag,newFrame = g.openWithFileName(path,None)
g.app.log.enable() # re-enable the log.

The Scripts node in LeoPy.leo contains a script called initScriptFind.  This script makes it easy to set up script based searches as follows:

1. Put the following code in the root of a tree that will contain your script search:

@color
# Initialize Leo's find panel using the named children of this node.
from leoGlobals import *
initScriptFind("Find script","Change script") # Second argument is optional.
# Start searching at the top.
top().selectVnode(c.rootVnode())
@nocolor

2. Put the search script in a child node called "Find script" (no quotes).

3. (Optional) Put the change script in a child node called "Change script"

4.  Execute the code above.  Leo does the following:

- Puts the body of the "Find script" into the find text of Leo's Find/Change dialog.
- Puts the body of the "Change script" into the change text of Leo's Find/Change dialog.
- Selects the Script Find radio button.
- Selects the Script Change checkbox if the change script exists.
- Selects the root of the entire outline.

Presto!  Leo is ready for a script search.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20040201114855"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20040201114855.3">This plugin uses Leo and docutils to mix program code and reST documentation.

The Python docutils package must be installed.http://docutils.sourceforge.net

If SilverCity is installed (http://silvercity.sourceforge.net) the plugin
produces HTML output that is syntax colored.

The basic approach is that any Leo node that contains program code that needs
documentation (in an ideal world it would be every node) has an associated child
node whose headline is simply '@rst', that contains reST-style documentation.
While this means that a typical program may have dozens (if not hundreds) of
these @rst nodes, it produces documentation that I think is as close as I have
ever seen to useful, easy-to-read documentation that is easy to create at the
same time as an application is being coded.

There are several interrelated aspects to this work:

- The reST plugin (renamed rst2) was hacked to manage Leo outlines that were a
combination of normal code nodes and reSt nodes.

- The plugin now recognizes a @rst directive (that has no associated file name)
in the headline of a node.

- When it encounters such a @rst Headline node, it writes the contents of the
body of the @rst node's *parent* (which generally contains program code) to the
reST output file (HTML) and then adds the reST content that is contained in the
body of the @rst documentation node to the output HTML file,

- These @rst nodes are used in @file-nosent trees and the @rst nodes have an 
@ignore directive (plus @nocolor directive and @wrap directives) so that 
when the @file is updated the application code does not contain the reST-style
documentation contained in the body of the @rst nodes. (This was the reason I
had asked you in the Leo Forum to allow @file-nosent trees to work appropriately
with @ignore nodes - Thank you for doing this right away.) There is no reason
that the reST content couldn't be written to the 
@file as documentation other than I personally believe in a volume of 
documentation (including musings, failed ideas, questions, etc.) that is 
probably best kept separate from the actual *.py files.

- When you double-click on a plain rst node (no associated filename) Leo opens
both the @rst documentation node and the parent node containing code in an
external editor *simultaneously*. I happen to use Textpad and so the code is
opened with python syntax coloring in one Textpad window and right next to it is
the reST documentation. This makes it much much easier to code and do
documentation at the same time. (Note that the plugin assumes that the python
extension is '.tp' since that is what I use with TextPad.)

So why is this a big deal?

For the first time in my experience the documentation process:

1) is completely in sync with the process of code development.

2) allows the programmer to write as much documentation as he/she wants without
the programming code becoming unreadable because of what would be considered
excessive or intrusive documentation. (This applies whether documentation is
intended for external consumption or just so a solo programmer can remember what
he/she was thinking...)

My conclusion is that Leo + reST/docutils provides the perfect platform for
optimal documentation. I have never completely understood what is meant by
Literate Programming but in my mind this is practical Literate Programming.

Frankly, I think this is all a minor miracle but maybe I've lost perspective.

<t tx="ekr.20040201114855.13">Adds a quick search to the toolbar in Leo.

A search box which behaves like a web site search is added, along with a "GO"
button to do quick searches right from the main Leo window. All the current
search options are retained except that "search body text" is explicitly set -
mainly because this is by far the most common use case.

Pressing &lt;CR&gt; while editing the text automatically does a search. Repeated
searches can be done by clicking the "GO" button.

The combo box also stores a list of previous searches, which can be selected to
quickly repeat a search. When activating a previous search the original search
mode is used.

- incremental search
- reverse search
- persist recent searches across Leo sessions
- use INI file to set options for list size, etc.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20040217085036.1">Here is the bug report I submitted to Python:

The documentation for encoding lines at

C:\Python23\Doc\Python-Docs-2.3.1\whatsnew\section-encodings.html

states:

"Encodings are declared by including a specially formatted comment in the
first or second line of the source file."

In fact, contrary to the implication, the Python 2.3 parser does not look
for lines of the form:

# -*- coding: &lt;encoding&gt; -*-

For example, Python improperly scans the following line for an encoding

#@+leo-ver=4-encoding=iso-8859-1.

and reports that iso-8859-1. (note trailing dot) is an invalid encoding!

The workaround for my app is to precede this line with the following line:

# -*- coding: iso-8859-1 -*-

This makes Python 2.3 happy.

To make myself perfectly clear: Python has absolutely no right to complain
about comment lines that do not have the form:

# -*- coding: &lt;encoding&gt; -*-</t>

<t tx="ekr.20040705111716.1">Leo will write only t.unknownAttributes to the .leo file when writing the &lt;v&gt; element corresponding to the root of an @thin tree.  Leo will do this by writing a new xml attribute, say descendentTnodeUnknownAttributes, in &lt;v&gt; element.

The reason that Leo will only write t.unknownAttributes and not v.unknownAttributes is that only tnodes have gnx's in thin derived files.  In effect, vnodes are anonymous.  We could attempt to get around this by identifying vnodes by their corresponding tnodes, but that's not a general solution and it is, in effect, equivalent to writing only t.unknownAttributes.  This being so, it seems pointless to "pretend" to be writing v.unknownAttributes.

The effect of this is to make all vnodes identical, as far as using unknownAttributes is concerned.  As I've stated in the past, this won't do if, for example, a plugin is trying create an arbitrary directed graph between vnodes.  In that case, the plugin should confine itself to @file trees, or just vnodes in .leo files, for that matter.

7/1/04:

This version of Leo is feature complete.  Leo's core code has been stable for several months.

To do: most plugins work with the new code base, but other plugins need some more work.

The highlights of Leo 4.2:

- @thin trees make Leo much more friendly to cvs. Files derived from @thin can
be committed to cvs and updated from cvs without having to commit or update the
corresponding .leo file. There is no longer any need to keep .leo files and
derived files in synch.

- Leo's data structures have been reorganized. As a result, all outline
operations are much faster. To support this organization, scripts that traverse
Leo's data structures must now use a positions rather than vnodes. Old scripts
that appear to use vnodes will still work because methods like c.currentVnode
that appear to return vnodes actually return positions.

- A new mod_scripting plugin is a big advance in scripting and testing.
test.leo now uses @test and @script nodes to define unit tests without
explicitly creating subclasses of unittest.TestCase. Converting scripts to unit
tests now takes a few seconds!

- A much faster and more robust spell checker plugin. (requires Python 2.3)

- Leo is now much more friendly to using spaces instead of tabs.

- The Execute Script command reports erroneous lines more clearly.

- The Perfect Import feature guarantee that Leo imports file exactly.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20040804164600.16">Leo now vetoes the shutdown logic if saving a dirty file fails.

Leo prints in red the warning about not being able save the read-only file. The
user can use the Save To command to save the file. The Save To command does not
clear the file's dirty bit, so Leo will prompt again to save the file. The user
will have to ignore this prompt in order to exit. This is correct: the
_original_ file has not been saved.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20040804164600.36">- g.getScript implicitly assumed that p == c.currentPosition.

This version fixes a number of minor bugs reported since the last release. See
the children of this node for details.

The highlights of Leo 4.2:

- @thin trees make Leo much more friendly to cvs. Files derived from @thin can
be committed to cvs and updated from cvs without having to commit or update the
corresponding .leo file. There is no longer any need to keep .leo files and
derived files in synch.

- Leo's data structures have been reorganized. As a result, all outline
operations are much faster. To support this organization, scripts that traverse
Leo's data structures must now use a positions rather than vnodes. Old scripts
that appear to use vnodes will still work because methods like c.currentVnode
that appear to return vnodes actually return positions.

- A new mod_scripting plugin is a big advance in scripting and testing.
test.leo now uses @test and @script nodes to define unit tests without
explicitly creating subclasses of unittest.TestCase. Converting scripts to unit
tests now takes a few seconds!

- A much faster and more robust spell checker plugin. (requires Python 2.3)

- Leo is now much more friendly to using spaces instead of tabs.

- The Execute Script command reports erroneous lines more clearly.

- The Perfect Import feature guarantee that Leo imports file exactly.</t>

By: hinsen

The shortcut definitions in Leo are quite inconvenient on the Mac, as those
using the Alt key don't work. Alt is used for entry of additional characters.
On the other hand, ctrl is available for shortcuts but not used in Leo, since
the ctrl-based shortcuts are shifted to the command key (following standard
Mac practice).

The patch at the end of this message simply shifts all Alt-shortcuts to Ctrl
on the Mac.

That leaves one minor clash: Command-` is used for CloneNode in Leo, although
it canonical MacOS function (switching between the windows of an application)
would be very useful in Leo as well. Removing the CloneNode binding is easy
enough, but it seems that I must implement a window switching function myself.
Not today :-)

<t tx="ekr.20050122084954">Leo stores options in @settings trees, that is, parts of Leo outlines whose root node has the headline @settings.  When opening a .leo file, Leo looks for @settings trees in the following places:

- The file called leoSettings.leo in the leo/config directory.
- The file called leoSettings.leo in the users home directory.
- The file being loaded.

Settings that later in the above list override settings found earlier. For example, any setting specified in an @settings tree in the file being loaded overrides any setting seen in any leoSettings.leo file.

The Settings command temporarily replaces the outline pane with an outline showing all the @settings trees in effect. The Settings command also replaces the body pane with a "settings dialog" pane. This settings dialog pane
allows you to change the settings selected in the outline pane using standard gui widgets.

The format of nodes in @settings trees are as follows:

1. "Simple settings nodes" have headlines of the form:

@&lt;type&gt; name = val

set the value of name to val, with the indicated type.

&lt;type&gt; may be one of the following, with valid values shown:

&lt;type&gt;          Valid values
-----           ------------
\@bool           True, False, 0, 1
\@color          A Tk color name or value, such as 'red' or 'xf2fddff' (without the quotes)

For a list of Tk color specifiers see:

- http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.4/TkCmd/colors.htm
- http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.4/TkLib/GetColor.htm

\@directory      A path to a directory
\@float          A floating point number of the form nn.ff.
\@int            An integer
\@ints[list]     An integer (must be one of the ints in the list).
                 Example: @ints meaningOfLife[0,42,666]=42
\@path           A path to a directory or file
\@ratio          A floating point number between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive.
\@string         A string
\@strings[list]  A string (must be one of the strings in the list).
                 Example: @strings tk_relief['flat','groove','raised']='groove'

2. "Complex settings nodes" have headlines of the form:

\@&lt;type&gt; description

The actual settings are specified in the body text.  At present, there are two such kinds of complex settings nodes:

- @font

The body text contains a list of settings for a font.  For example:

body_text_font_family = Courier New
body_text_font_size = None
body_text_font_slant = None
body_text_font_weight = None

- @recentFiles

The body text contains a list of paths of recently opened files, one path per line.

Warning: The following features of @recentfiles nodes are confusing and probably
will be changed:

- Leo does not save recent file information unless the open .leo file has an
@settings tree and an @recentfiles node within the @settings tree. That is, Leo
does not save recent files information in leoSettings.leo files.

- Changing the @rencentfiles node doesn't mark the Leo file as dirty, so if you
don't save the .leo file the recent files information will not be updated.

3.  All other nodes are "Organizer" nodes.  Such nodes have no effect on the settings shown in the dialog.  You may use them as you please to organize settings.

Notes:

A.  At present, you can not change @settings trees while executing the Settings command.  You can, however, change any @settings tree normally when not executing the Settings command.

B. Other kinds of settings nodes are planned for future releases.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050122090311">Leo 4.3 alpha 1                 January 24, 2005

Leo 4.3 is the culmination of more than four months of work. 

The defining features of Leo 4.3:

1. Leo now stores options in @settings trees, that is, outlines whose headline
is '@settings'. When opening a .leo file, Leo looks for @settings trees not only
in the outline being opened but also in various leoSettings.leo files.

The key design goal of @settings trees was that Leo's user options must be
infinitely flexible. That goal has been accomplished. Indeed, users can create
arbitrarily complex user options with @settings trees. Leo settings outlines
are, in fact, infinitely more flexible and powerful than any scheme based on
flat text.  Readers of Python's configParser shootout take note!

2. The Settings command temporarily replaces the outline pane with an outline
showing all the @settings trees in effect. The Settings command also replaces
the body pane with a "settings pane". This settings pane allows you to change
the settings selected in the outline pane using standard gui widgets. The
settings pane is dynamically created from nodes in the settings tree; it is as
extensible as the @settings tree itself.

3. Leo's read/write code in leoAtFile.py has been rewritten to support user-
defined tangling and untangling.  This is a major cleanup of Leo's core.

4. Leo now boasts a wonderful new Plugins Manager plugin. This plugin enables
and disables plugins automatically. This plugin also tells you everything you need to know
about each plugin. Finally, this plugin also lets you download plugins from
Leo's cvs site! Many thanks to Paul Patterson for this excellent work.

5. You can install third-party extensions in Leo's extensions directory. Leo
will attempt to import such extensions from the extensions directory if normal
imports fail.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050122091036">The essential features of @settings trees and the settings dialog appear to be stable.  However, many improvements can be imagined, including the following:

- Allow searching for nodes while in the settings dialog.

- Allow adding, deleting, rearranging nodes while in the settings dialog.

- Allow adding, deleting, rearranging recent files while in the settings dialog.

These will be added as time permits and people request.</t>

This sets self.encoding temporarily. The actual value of self.encoding does not

- We must _not_ set self.encoding in scanHeader: that would interfere with
normal initialization.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050123092834.81">- Restored non Pmw code in resizePanesToRatio.  This code got deleted by mistake.  The Equal Sized Panes works again.

- Added many do-nothing methods to nullMenu class.

This should prevent the startup logic from messing with shortcuts in any way.  It's also the right thing to do.

- Added an entry for EqualSizedPanes to leoSettings.leo.  This overrides the default (Ctrl-E) and thereby prevents the default from overriding the entry for ExecuteScript!

- Re-enabled code in createMenuEntries that warns when shortcuts have been redefined.  Not sure if this is a wise idea, or indeed if it actually does anything :-)

I am tempted to remove all the default entries entirely.  This would simplify error reporting, but then Leo would hardly work at all if leoSettings.leo were not present.</t>

general this makes no sense! Comment delimiters should be set once and for all
in the @+leo sentinel: there is no compiler in the world that tolerates mixed
comment delimiters.

BTW, the way to set javascript "inner" comments is to use @delims, not @comment.
N.B. The @language and @comment delimiters _will_ have an effect, and that
effect is in the _write_ logic, not the read logic. The effect is to set the
comment delims in the @+leo sentinel.

<t tx="ekr.20050123092834.565">Leo's code now contains an important simplification to Leo's gui code. This
arose because of a problem in the UNL plugin. The window that opened when double
clicking an @url UNL node wasn't staying on top.

It turns out that this was essentially impossible to fix with the old code. The
proximate cause of the original problem button-1 was bound to OnActivateTree,
which called g.app.gui.set_focus after the new window was visible, thereby
bringing the old tree to the front.

Further investigation revealed other problems. For example, the idle-time code
in the status line logic was also messing with the focus. It turns out that
repeatedly calling g.app.gui.set_focus is a very bad idea, for lots of reasons
which I won't go into in detail here.

The old code called g.app.gui.set_focus explicitly whenever it wanted focus to
change. But there is a much better way, namely to have routines that _indicate_
where they want the focus to be "after the dust settles", that is, when all gui
calls have been completed. I call this a "delayed focus" scheme.

So I rewrote all the code that sets the focus. The new code replaces direct
calls to g.app.gui.set_focus with calls to the following methods in
leoTkinterFrame class: bodyWantsFocus, statusLineWantsFocus, treeWantsFocus and
logWantsFocus. Actually, these xWantsFocus methods all do the same thing, but
using different methods improves traces.

This is an excellent pattern. Again, rather than setting the focus directly,
these xWantsFocus methods merely signal their intension to set the focus. This
allows very complex logic to be hidden in leoTkinterFrame.set_focus.

leoTkinterFrame.set_focus is indeed complex. It took me several hours this
morning to get it just right. It queues up a 'one-shot' callback. That is, at
most one copy of the callback is ever waiting to be executed. Furthermore, the
callback is only queued for execution at the result of a call to xWantsFocus; it
is never run automatically at idle time. Finally, even when executed, the
callback does nothing if the last requested commander (in the new ivar,
g.app.wantedFocus) does not match the commander to which the callback was bound.

These checks allow the UNL plugin to open a window properly and keep it topmost.

This is a big step forward for Leo, for the following reasons:

- Delayed focus ensures that the body pane always has focus unless the code has
a specific, positive reason for the focus to be elsewhere. This was difficult
(or rather impossible) to do with the old code: there are _many_ Tk calls that
can affect the focus.

- Delayed focus minimizes calls to g.app.gui.set_focus. Unlike the old code,
many seconds may elapse between calls. The stress on Tk is much less, and I
believe this may cure some flakiness in how focus changes, especially in
headlines.

- There are some cases where focus must change immediately. The xWantsFocus
methods all support a 'later' keyword argument. By default it is True, but when
it is False leoTkinterFrame.set_focus calls g.app.gui.set_focus immediately.

- The xWantsFocus methods all support a 'tag' keyword argument that tells what
routine the method is called from. It is a big help in making sense of traces.
BTW, extensive traces are the _only_ possible way of tracking down
focus/selection problems.</t>

Leo 4.3 is the culmination of more than four months of work. This alpha 2
release corrects various bugs and distribution problems.

a2 also adds several new features:

- Adds 'word', 'line' and 'node' undo granularities.
- Predefines 'c','g', and 'p' in scripts and unit tests.

Symptom

Can not import messages were not being sent to the console, even though there is a call to es in g.cantImport.

What I did

- The code in g.es now checks for nullLog as well as log == None when deciding when to queue messages.

- g.openWithFileName now calls g.app.writeWaitingLog immediately after enabling the new log.

This writes the queued log messages in the proper order: a major advance in clarity.

  File "C:\dn_apps\Leo\plugins\rst2.py", line 164, in onIconDoubleClick
    writeTreeAsRst(rstFile,fname,p,c)
TypeError: writeTreeAsRst() takes exactly 5 arguments (4 given)

So I looked at the rst2.py and found a way to get it working but I would need
someone to verify it :

line 164, replaced   writeTreeAsRst(rstFile,fname,p,c)  by

syntax = False
writeTreeAsRst(rstFile,fname,p,c,syntax)

And it worked!

- perform a search which marks a number of nodes
- select "Outline -&gt; Mark/Unmark -&gt; Unmark All"
- Several marks are still listed in in the nodenavigator "Marks" list.
  (They are not marked in the outline.)

What I did:

- The p.set/clearMark methods now call the hook _after_ changing the marked status.
  This fixes the apparent bug in nodenavigator.py.
- Rewrote nav_buttons.py.  The old code was a mess; the new code is clean.
- Changed the vnodeList ivar in leoTkinterDialog to positionList.
- Rewrote c.unmarkAll to make clear that it is using positions.
    - Added test_c_unmark_all test routine.</t>

Leo 4.3 alpha 1, build  1.208 , January 24, 2005
Python 2.3.4, Tk 8.4.3, win32

Opened a new .leo file. It asked for an ID, and said it saved it. Closed the
new leo file &amp; tried opening "Leo\config\leoSettings.leo". _It_ is asking for
a leoID!

What I did

All changes were to g.app.leoID():
    - Fixed bug:  set g.app.leoID in &lt;&lt; put up a dialog requiring a valid id &gt;&gt;.
    - Improved signon message.
    - Better error handling and reporting. </t>

Leo crashed when executing a script if the script was selected text in a new window.

What I did:

- g.getScript now calls g.getOutputNewline(c=c) rather than look at atFile.output_newline.

atFile.output_newline may not exist if a) the file is new and b) g.getScript
doesn't call atfile.write.

- Set scripting=scriptWrite in call to atFile.scanAllDirectives in atFile.write.

This suppresses the following irrelevant message when executing scripts:

    "No absolute directory specified anywhere."</t>

Leo 4.3 is the culmination of more than five months of work. This alpha 4
focuses on plugins: all known plugins are now in leoPlugins.leo. Most plugins
now work with the 4.3 code base. Warning: not all plugins have been tested
thoroughly.

This alpha 4 release also adds the frequently-requested Add Comments and Delete
Comments commands to Leo's Edit Body menu.

The defining features of Leo 4.3:

1. Leo now stores options in @settings trees, that is, outlines whose headline
is '@settings'. When opening a .leo file, Leo looks for @settings trees not only
in the outline being opened but also in various leoSettings.leo files.

The key design goal of @settings trees was that Leo's user options must be
infinitely flexible. That goal has been accomplished. Indeed, users can create
arbitrarily complex user options with @settings trees. Leo settings outlines
are, in fact, infinitely more flexible and powerful than any scheme based on
flat text.  Readers of Python's configParser shootout take note!

2. The Settings command temporarily replaces the outline pane with an outline
showing all the @settings trees in effect. The Settings command also replaces
the body pane with a "settings pane". This settings pane allows you to change
the settings selected in the outline pane using standard gui widgets. The
settings pane is dynamically created from nodes in the settings tree; it is as
extensible as the @settings tree itself.

3. Leo's read/write code in leoAtFile.py has been rewritten to support user-
defined tangling and untangling.  This is a major cleanup of Leo's core.

4. Leo now boasts a wonderful new Plugins Manager plugin. This plugin enables
and disables plugins automatically. 
This plugin also tells you everything you need to know
about each plugin. Finally, this plugin also lets you download plugins from
Leo's cvs site! Many thanks to Paul Patterson for this excellent work.

5. You can install third-party extensions in Leo's extensions directory. Leo
will attempt to import such extensions from the extensions directory if normal
imports fail. Leo is distributed with Pmw (Python Mega Widgets), path.py and
sets.py in this directory.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20050313101229.94">Several hooks use the 'new_c' key in the keywords dictionary. Plugin writers had
to remember whether to get the commander using keywords.get('c') or
keywords.get('new_c') or both. This was needlessly confusing.

All hooks that use the 'new_c' key now use also include the 'c' key. The 'new_c'
key is deprecated; plugins should use the 'c' key instead. 

None of the plugins presently in leoPlugins.leo use the 'new_c' key, but the
'new_c' key still exists for compatibility.

The following plugins were affected by this change:

<t tx="ekr.20050429094215.3">The initial bug report:

http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3048149

The problem arose from a misguided attempt to eliminate non-useful information
from traces. Alas, the baby got thrown out with the bath water.

Here are the changes I made:

 - c.executeScript now calls g.es_exception(full=True) to ensure that a full
 stack trace always gets produced. This is especially important when the
 exception happens in a module (file) called by the script.

- c.executeScript now always executes the section &lt; &lt; dump the lines near the
error &gt; &gt;, regardless of context. The lines are printed (in black) in the log.
This is useful information in almost all cases.

- After much experimentation, g.es_exception is basically unchanged. Note: If
the error occurs in your script itself (as contrasted with an exception thrown
from a file called by your script) Leo always has properly put the cursor on the
offending line. I made no changes in this logic.

BTW, calling pdb.set_trace() in your scripts may cause more problems than it is
worth. Indeed.pdb.set_trace() uses only the information on the stack, and that
may not be enough information to be useful. I usually use g.trace to find out
what is happening. This works well.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050429094215.22">Initial bug report:

http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3053699

There were three similar bugs, all arising from the fact that g.os_path_abs and
g.os_path_join return the _working_ directory if the initial path is None!

I removed my HOME directory for testing. This was essential.

- Compute home directory must return None, rather than the working directory if
the HOME variable is None.

- app.setLeoId must be careful (in two sections) to do nothing if any of
(homeDir,globalConfigDir,loadDir) is None.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050429094215.31">The problem is that newButtons must use @nosent, so any changes to newButtons

<t tx="ekr.20050429094215.131">- Moved computeGlobalConfigDir, computeHomeDir, computeLoadDir and startupEncoding from leo.py to leoGlobals.py.

- Created g.computeStandardDirectories and used it in leo.py.

- Created g.createStandAloneApp using the above functions.  This function was based on the 'Standalone Operation' classed in the plugin_manager plugin.  g.createStandAloneApp doesn't actually use any of these classes because the nullGui class is basically a clumsier version of the BlackHole class.

- Added a do-nothing attachLeoIcon method to nullGui class to suppress a warning.  As I said, the nullGui class is not as elegant as Paul's BlackHole class.

- Added &lt;&lt;importLeoGlobals&gt;&gt; button to newButtons plugin.  This creates a node named
  &lt;&lt; define importLeoGlobals &gt;&gt; whose body text defines an importLeoGlobals function.

The idea is that importing leoGlobals from a stand-alone plugin is a bit tricky.  The importLeoGlobals handles these details.  Note that we don't want to define importLeoGlobals in a node included by @others, because this function must be available to the code in the &lt;&lt; imports &gt;&gt; section.  So we use a named section and reference it in before referencing the &lt;&lt; imports &gt;&gt; section.  See the plugin_manager plugin for an example.

- Changed the plugin_manager plugin as follows:
    - Used the newButtons plugin to add an &lt;&lt; define importLeoGlobals &gt;&gt; section.
    - Simplified the import logic using importLeoGlobals function.
    - Commented out the Standalone Operation classes.
    - Called g.createStandAloneApp in the '__name__ == "__main__"' code.</t>

- Eliminated outputList var.
    - The code that writes to a clipboard sets self.outputFile to g.fileLikeObject.

- Sped up put routine: it always writes to self.outputFile.

- self.outputFile is now a cStringIo object.  However, the heart of the put routine is:

    s = g.toEncodedString(s,self.leo_file_encoding,reportErrors=True)
    self.outputFile.write(s)

and it appears that the call to g.toEncodedString is the limiting factor.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050429094215.173">- Use g.Bunch to simplify code.
- Added 'before' &amp; 'after' methods
- Added entries to optionalIvars dynamically in bead methods.
- Eliminated 'case-itis' by making it unnecessary ever to add more cases.
- Removed 'v' key in undoer:  replaced it with 'p'.
- Replaced u.v by u.p and v by p in find code (It's too confusing).
- p.setDirty and p.setAllAncestorAtFileNodesDirty  return list of nodes that were marked dirty.
- Create new top-level before/after methods &amp; helpers:
- Changed setUndoTypingParams to use new dispatch method.
- Removed makeBeadDict.
- Removed updateSetChangedFlag.
- Added new methods to nullUndoer class.
- Moved undo methods from leoNodes.py to leoUndo.py

<t tx="ekr.20050429094215.316">The only changes concern how Leo encodes and decodes items in
t.unknownAttributes and v.unknownAttributes.

Without changing the file format, the only way to tell Leo how to write
attributes is to use naming conventions. When writing attributes, Leo now does
the following:

- Do nothing except apply xml escapes if the attribute name (in
t.unknownAttributes or v.unknownAttributes) starts with str_ and the attribute
is, in fact, a string. If the string is a Unicode string Leo converts the
Unicode string to an encoded string.

- Use the present pickling/hexlifying scheming otherwise. In particular, issue a
warning and ignore the attribute if the attribute can not be pickled. BTW, there
is no need for separate base64 support: hexlifying guarantees that the result is
valid in any xml environment.

Leo now does the reverse when reading.

BTW, plugins could add their own naming conventions in an emergency. Indeed, the
conventions will be confined to code in atFile.putUa and atFile.getUa, so a
plugin would only need to override these two methods.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050429094215.347">Removed inAtOthers  param from putOpen/CloseNodeSentinel.

Note: most(all?) top-level atFile.write methods pass toString to initWriteIvars.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050429094215.353">Leo stores recent files information as follows.

1. Leo stores recent files info in files called .leoRecentFiles.txt. These will
be a plain text files with one line per recent files entry. An Easter egg: if
the file starts with read-only, read_only, readonly, etc. Leo will never update
the file and will not remember changes to the Recent Files menu.

2. On startup, Leo searches for the .leoRecentFiles.txt files in the user's home
directory, if it exists. Leo looks in Leo's config directory next, but only if
the home directory does not exist, or does not contain a .leoRecentFiles.txt
file. In other words, Leo will use at most one .leoRecentFiles.txt file on
startup.

3. When opening a .leo file, Leo looks for .leoRecentFiles.txt in the directory
containing the file.

4. At no time after installation does Leo create any .leoRecentFiles.txt file.
This will allow users (or their managers) to set policy regarding where to store
this information (if anywhere).

5. Leo writes at most one .leoRecentFiles.txt file when saving a .leo file,
namely the file read in item 3 if it exists, or the file read in item 2
otherwise.

This is a flexible scheme that should meet most needs without having to resolve
thorny questions about exactly where recent files info belongs.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050429094215.354">@killcolor

- Properly implemented undo/redo Clear Recent Files.

- readSettingsFiles now reads @recentfiles nodes from all settings files.

- Created @settings nodes and @recent-files nodes if they do not exist.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050429094215.355">@killcolor

You all have convinced me that storing recent files data in .leo files is a dubious idea. My new plan is as follows:

1. Leo will store recent files info in files called .leoRecentFiles.txt.  These will be a plain text files with one line per recent files entry.  These will be local files, so problems concerning directory structure and path specifications should go away.

2.  On startup, Leo will search for the .leoRecentFiles.txt files in the user's home directory, if it exists.  Leo will look in Leo's config directory next, but only if the home directory does not exist, or does not contain a .leoRecentFiles.txt file.  In other words, Leo will use at most one .leoRecentFiles.txt file on startup.

3.  When opening a .leo file, Leo will look for .leoRecentFiles.txt in the directory containing the file.

4.  At no time after installation will Leo create any .leoRecentFiles.txt file.  This will allow users (or their managers) to set policy regarding where to store this information (if anywhere).

5.  Leo will write at most one .leoRecentFiles.txt file when saving a .leo file, namely the file read in item 3 if it exists, or the file read in item 2 otherwise.

6.  Leo will have settings to tell which .leoRecentFiles.txt files may be written.

7. Leo will never create @settings nodes or @recent-files nodes automatically.  Moreover, I shall remove the @recent-files panel from the settings dialog and the corresponding @recent-files code from the config classes.

I believe this will address everyone's concerns without the need for resolving thorny questions about exactly where recent files info belongs.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050429095849">- Saved expansion state of @settings trees when the user hits the OK button.

- Added support for UNL's in the status line when the settings dialog is active.

- Debugged @if-platform, @if-gui, @ints &amp; @strings.

- Reloaded settings files when opening the settings dialog.

- Removed support for @recent-files nodes.  This is now handled by .leoRecentFiles.txt files.</t>

keywords.get('c').  This was an old bug, arising from the rewrite of the plugin.

I added a warning to that effect in the plugin template.

It would perhaps be better to specify an optional commander in registerHandler
and only call the handler if the commander matches. However, this isn't so easy
or clean to do.I

The plugin was failing to set the positionList ivar (in the base
tkinterListBoxDialog class). This was a fairly recent blunder: I saw that
positionList wasn't used in the plugin directly, so I 'improved' the code by
using a local var instead of self.positionList. This illustrates a hazard of
using subclassing.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20050523092026">Leo 4.3 final                 May 23, 2005

Leo 4.3 is here after almost five months of work.

The defining features of Leo 4.3:
---------------------------------
1. Leo now stores options in @settings trees, that is, outlines whose headline
is '@settings'. When opening a .leo file, Leo looks for @settings trees not only
in the outline being opened but also in various leoSettings.leo files.

The key design goal of @settings trees was that Leo's user options must be
infinitely flexible. That goal has been accomplished. Indeed, users can create
arbitrarily complex user options with @settings trees. Leo settings outlines
are, in fact, infinitely more flexible and powerful than any scheme based on
flat text.  Readers of Python's configParser shootout take note!

2. The Settings command temporarily replaces the outline pane with an outline
showing all the @settings trees in effect. The Settings command also replaces
the body pane with a "settings pane". This settings pane allows you to change
the settings selected in the outline pane using standard gui widgets. The
settings pane is dynamically created from nodes in the settings tree; it is as
extensible as the @settings tree itself.

3. Leo now stores recent files information in .leoRecentFiles.txt files.

4. Leo's read/write code in leoAtFile.py has been rewritten to support user-
defined tangling and untangling.  This is a major cleanup of Leo's core.

5. Leo now boasts a wonderful new Plugins Manager plugin. This plugin enables
and disables plugins automatically. This plugin also tells you everything you need to know
about each plugin. Finally, this plugin also lets you download plugins from
Leo's cvs site! Many thanks to Paul Patterson for this excellent work.

6. You can install third-party extensions in Leo's extensions directory. Leo
will attempt to import such extensions from the extensions directory if normal
imports fail. Leo is distributed with Pmw (Python Mega Widgets), path.py and
sets.py in this directory.</t>

By: rogererens

I swear I didn't wait for the release to be the first to report a bug! I just
didn't try this in the alpha/beta versions:

Leo 4.3 final, build  1.262 , May 23, 2005
Python 2.4.1, Tk 8.4.7, win32

Changing
Global settings: C:\Leo\config\leoSettings.leo--&gt;Window options--&gt;@page Options
for new windows--&gt;@ratio initial_horizontal_ratio = 0.3
or any of the other ratios, does not save them to leoSettings.leo. So after
restarting I still have the old settings in use.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050620144052.6">http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3167166

The fix was to add the following line to the init function:

    global click_registry, coloured_nodes</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050620144052.8">Modifying outlines can invalidate existing positions!  This rarely happens.  At present it affects the atFile.read logic when reading an outline whose initial current position is a clone outside an @thin tree with another clone inside the @thin tree.  So the read logic computes the expected current position before reading all derived files, and this expected current position becomes invalid.

What I did:

1.  Moved &lt;&lt; set current and top positions &gt;&gt; from getVnodes to end of getLeoFile.
This ensures that the outline won't change after computing the position.

2. Unit tests will have to be revised to make sure that only valid positions get used.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050620144052.48">- Fixed bugs in convertAllBlanks and convertAllTabs.

These must always call afterChangeGroup to match beforeChangeGroup, even if
nothing has changed.

- Added u.getMark and u.rollbackToMark.

These allow unit tests to cut the undo stack back to an initial position in the
tearDown method. This should be done for all tests that use u.undo and u.redo
methods. The bug was probably the result of changing the outline in the tearDown
method.

Both the Reformat Paragraph and Edit Body unit tests now roll back the undo stack.

- Added traces for unexpected conditions in u.undo, u.redo and tree.select.

- Call u.setUndoTypes() in u.setUndoTypingParams when returning early.

- Corrected Edit Body unit tests.

These tests should not call undo/redo when nothing is expected to change. Doing
so may trigger the new 'cant undo' traces in u.undo.

- doTest in leoTest.py now makes copies of both p and p1.

It's not clear that this is needed, it can't hurt, and it may have been important.</t>

colored words?

To learn about Leo, see: http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of 4.3.2:
-----------------------

- Improved Leo's documentation:
    - A tutorial introduction to Leo:
      http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html
    - A 5-minute guide to programming with Leo:
      http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html#quick-start-for-programmers

- The new rst3 plugin creates .html and .tex files from reStructuredText
  embedded in Leo files. Any node of the source outline may contain options for
  the rst3 plugin, which makes this plugin much more useful and flexible than
  the previous rst plugins. All of Leo's documentation was created using this
  plugin from sources in LeoDocs.leo. For full documentation for rst3 see:
  http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/rstplugin3.html.

- The spellpyx (spell checking) plugin is now much easier to use.

- The vim and openWith plugins now use Python's subprocess module if it is present.
 
- Improved the Pretty Printing command.

- The usual assortment of bug fixes.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050906104918.1">Here is a summary of the changes:

- General:  All chapters created with rst3 plugin.  This ensures a uniform look.  The source is in LeoDocs.leo.  Removed all references to older versions of Leo, except when discussing old file formats in the Appendices.  Corrected all text so it discusses present version.

- rst3 plugin itself:  Correct bug that caused chapters to be formatted differently when processing multiple @rst trees.  

- rst3 button in LeoDocs.leo:  The script first looks *up* the tree, looking for an @rst node.  If found, it processes just that tree.  If not found, it processes all @rst nodes *below* the originally selected node.  The button is now much more convenient to use.

- Preface: Shorter, no history.  No longer a dead end.

- What People are Saying About Leo: No longer a dead end.

- FAQ: Reorganized, simplified, revised.  Added entries for running Leo in a console window and debugging docutils.  Improved entry for using cvs.

- Chapter 1: Installation: Now the first chapter.  Revised.

- Chapter 2: Tutorial: Completely rewritten.  Like Python's tutorial, this chapter contains everything a beginner needs to understand and use Leo.  The `Quickstart for programmers` section is the heart of this chapter.  All terms used have links either to their definition in the tutorial or in the Glossary.  Newbies should be able to digest this chapter easily.  This chapter should make Leo comprehensible to many more people.

- Chapter 3: Using Outlines: Revised per general remarks above.

- Chapter 4: Writing Programs in Leo.  Completely rewritten.  The old chapter was an embarrassment. The new chapter is a reference guide, properly organized as such.  The introduction warns newbies away.

- Chapter 5: Using Leo's Commands.  'Minor' revisions and corrections create a substantially better result.

- Chapter 6: Leo and literate programming: Reformatting helps.  New words about rST markup and other improvements over traditional LP.

- Chapter 7: Scripting Leo with Python: Rewritten, simplified, updated and corrected.  The sources in LeoDocs.leo are directly executable.  rST sources use literal blocks instead of code-blocks so that the sources are simplified. (Important when executing examples).  Properly discusses positions, including 'supremely important' section on copying positions.

- Chapter 8: Customizing Leo.  Heavily revised.  Discusses leoSettings.leo, not leoConfig.txt.  Security warnings are more reasonable.  Section on script buttons. Rewrote section on uA's (Adding extensible attributes to nodes and .leo files).

- Chapter 9: History of Leo.  Rewritten.  Much shorter and more useful.  Discusses the major milestones, concentrating on explaining the major differences between versions.  Gone are details of how discoveries came to be.  They are in LeoPostings.leo, which will be included in the distribution.

- Chapter 10: Theory of Operation.  Largely rewritten.  Discusses positions properly.  Omits discussion of how clones were implemented before 4.2.

- Chapter 11: White Papers.  A new chapter.  This is a slightly-edited version of writing that had been buried in the appendices.

- Appendices.  Heavily revised and reformatted.  Rewrote sections on file formats.

- Glossary: A separate chapter.  All terms have links to their definition.  All definitions are rST targets so other chapters may refer to them.  Added several new entries.

<t tx="ekr.20050908164150.1">See http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/rstplugin3.html for full documentation
of this plugin.

The rst3 plugin creates output files from Leo outlines containing
reStructuredText (rST) ReStructuredText is a simple and powerful text formatting
markup language. Outlines are a natural way to organize rST (or any text).

This plugin adds the Write Restructured Text command to Leo's Edit menu. The
Write Restructured Text command searches the selected outline looking for rst
root nodes whose headline have the form @rst &lt;filename&gt;. The plugin then creates
the named file in various ways depending which rst3 options are in effect.

By default, the rst3 plugin creates rST headings automatically from outlines, so
the higher-level nodes in the outline correspond to higher-level sections in the
output. Creating rST headings automatically relieves you from one of the most
tedious chores in creating rST markup.

To use this plugin effectively, Python's docutils module must be installed. The
rst3 plugin will use the SilverCity syntax coloring package if it installed.

This plugin sends .htm, .html or .tex files to the docutils module for further
processing. Docutils generates HTML files or LaTeX files depending on the file's
extension. HTML files generated by docutils refer to three .css (cascading style
sheet) files that should exist in the same directory as the generated HTML file.
You can control the formatting of the HTML file by altering these .css files.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050908164150.2">This plugin now allows quotes within words, but strips quotes and other cruft
from the beginning and end of words. As a result, using the spellpyx spell
checker is much easier than before.

Leo's extensions folder now contains aspell23.pyd and aspell24.pyd. These are
Python dll's compiled for Python 2.3 and 2.4 respectively. You must rename one
of these files to be aspell.pyd and move aspell.pyd to the aspell folder. For
more details, see the installation nodes in the docstring for the spellpyx
plugin.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050909082711">- Fixed bug with non-unicode characters in file name

    http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3224635
    
    Leo crashed try to read .leo files whose name contained non-ascii characters.

- Fixed bug with non-unicode characters in settings value

    http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3222750
    
    Leo crashed try to write settings whose values contained non-ascii characters.

    http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3307318</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050910143326">These plugins now use Python's subprocess module if it is present. The
subprocess module comes standard with Python 2.4. For Linux systems, Leo will
use subprocess.py in Leo's extensions folder if necessary.

For Windows systems you can install Python's subprocess module in Python 2.2 or
2.3 as follows:
    
    - Go to http://www.effbot.org/downloads/#subprocess

    - Download and execute one of the following installers, depending on your version of Python:
        subprocess-0.1-20041012.win32-py2.3.exe 
        subprocess-0.1-20041012.win32-py2.2.exe
        
This installer installs the subprocess sources and also _subprocess.pyd in Python's site-packages folder.

Here would be a nice place to insert 2 screen shots that illustrate the points
discussed: one of a very small @thin tree in Leo, and one of the contents of
the file that's derived from that node, as seen in vim or jEdit or notepad.

Also the paragraph on clones might benefit from a screen shot or two, especially
since the tutorial contains a lot of text and ideas to grasp. Pictures in between
give the opportunity to ponder on the meaning of all that for a while while
staring at them...</t>

##########################################
The Essentials of Leo
##########################################

.. .. contents::</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050916184158.2">Leo organizes all data into nodes containing a **headline**, an expandable page of
**body text** and a (possibly empty) subtree of **descendant nodes**. The **contents** of a
node are its headline and body text. Leo’s main window contains an **outline** pane
at the top left, a **log pane** at the top right, and a **body pane** at the bottom. The
outline pane shows headlines; the body pane shows the body text of the selected
headline. The log pane displays messages from Leo.

Small red arrows mark **cloned nodes** (clones). Clones share the same content and
descendants. All clones of the same node are equivalent, so changing the
contents of one node (call it node N) changes the contents of all clones of N.
Furthermore, inserting, deleting or changing any descendant of node N causes the
corresponding insertion, deletion or change in all other clones of N.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050916184158.3">Clones allow you to organize data in multiple ways within the same outline. You
do not have to choose a single ‘correct’ organization: you can organize your
data in as many ways as you like.

You can use **organizer nodes** to create explicit relations (relationships) among
the data in your outline. The headline of the organizer node is the
relationship’s name. Now make clones of nodes from other parts of the outline
that participate in the relation. Drag the newly created clones so they become
children of the organizer node. You may want to create other (non-cloned)
children of the organizer node that contain data found nowhere else in the
outline. Voilà: you have just created the set of all nodes that pertain to the
relationship. The organizer node is the relation; the terms relation,
relationship and organizer node are interchangeable.

Three kinds of relations deserve special mention. A **view** is a relation (an
organizer node) containing all nodes related to a desired view (or slice) of the
data in the outline. Similarly, a **task** is an organizer node containing all nodes
related to a task. Relations are not limited to tasks or views: the notion of
relationship is completely general. Headlines naturally describe the data in
body text. That is, nodes relate **metadata** (descriptions of data) to data.
Separating data from metadata is useful for humans. It is even more valuable for
scripts: scripts can access data and metadata without complex parsing.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050916184158.4">Plugins are Python (.py) files contained in Leo’s plugins folder. Users can
write plugins to change how Leo works and to add new features without changing
Leo’s core code. We’ll discuss plugins in more detail later.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050916184158.5">Leo can generate many external files called **derived files** from an outline. Leo
outlines can organize files throughout your computer’s file system. Nodes whose
headlines start with ‘@’ are special nodes. Several **special nodes** indicate the
root of a tree that generates a derived file::

    @asis filename    Creates a derived file. Ignores all markup in body text.
    @file filename    Creates a derived file. Duplicates outline structure in .leo file.
    @noref filename   Creates a derived file. Ignores all section references.
    @nosent filename  Creates a derived file without sentinels.
    @thin filename    (Recommended) Like @file, but thin derived files contain all outline structure.

Leo recognizes several other special nodes::

    @settings   Defines settings local to the .leo file.
    @url url    Double-clicking the node’s icon opens the url in Leo or in a browser.

The scripting plugin scans for the following nodes when opening an outline::

    @button         Creates a button in the **icon area** at the top of the Leo window.
    @plugin plugin  Enables a plugin if the plugin has not already been enabled.
    @script         Executes a script when opening the outline. This is a security risk: it is disabled by default.

Plugins, @button nodes and @script nodes can create other kinds of special nodes::

    @suite       Creates a suite of unit tests from script in body. Requires scripting plugin.
    @test        Creates a unit text from script in body. Requires scripting plugin.
    @rst         Outputs a tree containing markup for reStructuredText. Requires rst2 plugin.
    @run command Double clicking the node’s icon executes the command.  Requires run_nodes plugin.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050916184158.6">Leo’s Execute Script command **preprocesses** the script to be executed by scanning
a node N and its descendants looking for markup. **Markup** is special syntax that
controls this preprocessing. If node N contains no markup, the resulting script
is just N’s body text. Otherwise, the preprocessed script will include text from
descendant nodes as described below. The main kinds of markup are **section
references**, **directives** and **doc parts**.

1.  **Section references** have the form::

        &lt;&lt;section name&gt;&gt;

    The ``&lt;&lt;`` and ``&gt;&gt;`` must appear on the same line. Conversely, any line
    containing ``&lt;&lt;`` and ``&gt;&gt;`` is a section reference, regardless of context. However,
    section references are not recognized in doc parts. Any characters may appear
    between ``&lt;&lt;`` and ``&gt;&gt;``.
    
    Section references are functional pseudo-code: while preprocessing a script, Leo
    replaces section references by the actual text of the section’s definition.
    Sections are defined in **section definition nodes**, whose headlines start with a
    section reference and whose body text defines the section. Each section
    definition node must descend from the node containing the section reference.

2.  **Directives** start with ‘@’ in the leftmost column of body text. Directives
    specify options and control Leo’s operation. The ``@others`` directive is the
    minimal markup needed to organize scripts. ``@others`` tells Leo to insert the
    preprocessed text of all descendant nodes (except section definition nodes) at
    the spot at which the ``@others`` directive occurs. Nodes are inserted in **outline
    order**, the order in which nodes appear in the outline. **Important**: Leo adds the
    whitespace preceding the ``@others`` directive to the indentation of all
    preprocessed text.
    
    Using ``@others`` is more convenient than using section references. Use ``@others`` when
    the order of included text does not matter::
    
        class myClass:
	        @others # Include the methods of the class. Order doesn’t matter.

    Use section references when the order of included text does matter. In the following script, for example,
    &lt;&lt; imports &gt;&gt; ensures that imports come first. The ``@others`` directive then includes the body text of all other
    descendant nodes::
    
        @language python
        &lt;&lt; imports&gt;&gt;
        @others # Define classes &amp; functions in child nodes.
        main()

    Here is a list of all of Leo’s standard directives::
    
        @whitespace (or @doc)   Starts a doc part &amp; ends code part.
        @all                    Like @others, but includes all descendant nodes.
        @c, @code               Starts a code part and ends a doc part.
        @color                  Enables syntax coloring.
        @delims                 Temporarily changes comment delims.
        @nocolor, @killcolor    Disables syntax coloring.
        @comment                Sets comment delimiters in external (derived) files.
        @language languagename  Sets language for syntax coloring and comments.
        @lineending lineending  Sets ending of lines in derived files.
        @others                 Inserts body text of all descendants except definition nodes. 
        @pagewidth n            Sets page width for justifying comments in doc parts.
        @path path              Sets prefix to use in relative file names in @file nodes, etc.
        @root filename          Marks the root of a tree that creates an external file.
        @raw, @end_raw          Inhibits sections references in a range of text. (@file only.)
        @tabwidth n             Sets width of tabs (negative widths convert tabs to spaces.)
        @wrap, @nowrap          Controls wrapping of text in body pane.
    
3.  Doc parts start with the ‘@’ directive and continue until the end of the body text or until the ‘@c’ directive.
    Body text not in a doc part is in a code part. Here is an example of a doc part::

        @ This is a doc part. Doc parts may span many lines. Leo converts doc parts to comments.
        Leo reformats the doc part by justifying lines so they are no longer than the page width.
        @c

    Leo reformats doc parts by justifying the text into comment lines.
    The ``@pagewidth`` directive controls the length of these comment lines.
    The ``@language`` and ``@comment`` directives specify the comment delimiters used in doc parts.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050916184158.7">The ``Execute Script`` command preprocesses the selected text of the presently
selected outline node, or the entire text of the node if there is no selected
text. See the section called ``Markup for Scripts`` for a discussion of how Leo
preprocesses scripts. That section also discusses how Leo organizes scripts
using outlines. Conversely, scripts can use outlines to organize their data. To
write such scripts you must understand at least the basics of Leo’s modules and
classes...
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050916184158.8">Leo’s source code is organized as a collection of modules. The following
paragraphs describe five of the most important modules. See ``LeoPy.leo`` (Leo’s
full source code) for more details: scripts have full access to all of Leo’s
classes and data.

1.  The **leoGlobals** module contains utility functions.
    By convention, in Leo’s code ``g`` is always the ``leoGlobals`` module.

2.  The **leoApp** module defines a class representing the entire Leo application.
    **g.app** is the singleton object of this class: the application object.
    The instance variables (ivars) of the application object are Leo’s global variables.
 
3.  The leoCommands module defines the Commands class.
    A commander is an instance of this class.
    Commanders contain the operations that can be performed on a particular outline.
    Each open Leo outline has its own commander.
    By convention, in Leo’s code **c** is always a commander.

4.  The leoFrame module defines the base leoFrame class for objects that create and manage
    the visual appearance of Leo’s windows and panes.
    The **leoTkinterFrame** and **leoTkinterTree** modules contain subclasses of the base classes in the leoFrame module.
    A frame (an instance of the leoFrame class, or a subclass)
    contains all the internal data needed to manage a Leo window.
    **c.frame** is the frame associated with commander c.
    If **f** is a frame, **f.c** is the frame’s commander, **f.body** is the frame’s body pane,
    **f.tree** is the frame’s outline pane, and **f.log** is the frame’s log pane.

5.  The leoNodes module defines several classes that implement Leo’s fundamental data structures.
    These classes are complex.
    Happily, scripts can and should ignore these complications by accessing nodes using
    high-level methods of the position class.

A **position** (an instance of the position class) is the state of some traversal of an outline. Equivalently, a position is a particular visual place in an outline. Cloned nodes may appear many times in an outline. Non-cloned nodes may also appear in many places: consider a non-cloned descendant of a cloned node. By convention, in Leo’s source code p is a position.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050916184158.9">When executing scripts Leo predefines the following three symbols:
**c** is the commander of the outline in which the script is defined,
**g** is the leoGlobals module and
**p** is the position of the selected node in c’s outline, i.e., ``c.p``.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050916184158.10">Scripts should get and set data using high-level access methods. Here are some important getters::

    g.app                The application object. Its ivars are Leo’s global variables.
    g.app.windowList     The list of all open frames.
    c.p                  The position of the selected node.
    c.currentPosition()  A longer name for c.p.
    c.rootPosition()     The position of the first node in the outline.
    p.h                  The headline of position p.
    p.headString()       A longer name for p.h
    p.b                  The body text of position p.
    p.bodyString()       A longer name for p.b
    p.childIndex()       The number of siblings that precede p.
    p.numberOfChildren() The number of p’s children.
    p.level()            The number of p’s ancestors.
    p.hasChildren()      True if p has children.
    p.isAncestorOf(p2)   True if p2 is a child, grandchild, etc. of p.
    p.isCloned()         True if p is a clone.
    p.isDirty()          True if p’s contents have been changed.
    p.isExpanded()       True if p has children and p’s outline is expanded.
    p.isMarked()         True if p’s headline is marked.
    p.isVisible()        True if all of p’s ancestors are expanded.

And here are some important setters::

    p.b = s     Set body text of p to s.
    p.h = s     Set headline of p to s.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050916184158.11">Scripts can visit some or all of the nodes of a Leo outline using the following iterators::

    c.allNodes_iter             # All positions in the outline, in outline order.
    p.children_iter()           # All children of p.
    p.parents_iter()            # All parents of p.
    p.siblings_iter()           # All siblings of p, including p.
    p.following_siblings_iter() # All siblings following p, not including p.

For example, the following prints all the nodes of an outline, properly indented::

    for p in c.allNodes_iter():
        print ' '*p.level(), p.h</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050916184158.12">Scripts may open other Leo outlines, or execute any of Leo’s commands.  Here are some examples::

    ok,frame = g.openWithFileName(path,c)	# Opens the .leo file found at path.
    c.deleteOutline()   # Deletes the selected node.
    c.insertHeadline()  # Inserts a new node after present position.

For more examples, see ``Chapter 7: Scripting Leo with Python``, in ``Leo’s Users Guide``.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050916184158.13">The scripting plugin creates two buttons in the icon area at the top of the Leo
window. The ``Run Script`` button executes the script in the selected node just
like the ``Execute Script`` command. The ``Script Button`` button creates a new
button whose headline is the headline of the presently selected node, call it
node N. Pressing this button executes the script in node N with p predefined as
``c.p`` at the time the script is executed. This clever trick
brings the script to the data in the selected outline.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050916184158.14">``test.leo`` contains all of Leo’s unit tests. An ``@button node`` in test.leo
creates a blue ``Unit Test`` button in the icon area. This button is an
excellent example of bringing scripts to data. The ``Unit Test`` button executes
all the unit tests specified by ``@test`` and ``@suite`` nodes in the selected
outline. **Important**: ``@button``, ``@test`` and ``@suite`` nodes require the
scripting plugin to be enabled.

``@test`` nodes greatly simplify unit testing. The ``Unit Test`` button creates
a unit test from the body text of each ``@test`` node. In effect, the ``Unit
Test`` button automatically creates an instance of ``unittest.TestCase`` whose
run method is the body text of the @test node. There is no need to create
``TestCase`` objects explicitly!

``@suite`` nodes support legacy unit tests. When the ``Unit Test`` script button
finds an ``@suite node`` it executes the script in its body text. This script
should create a suite of unit tests and set::

    g.app.scriptDict['suite'] = suite

where suite is the created suite. The ``Unit Test`` button then runs that
created suite of unit tests.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050916184158.15">Plugins are Python (.py) files in Leo’s plugin subdirectory. It is easy to
create new plugins: Leo’s users have contributed dozens of plugins that extend
Leo’s capabilities in new ways. Leo imports all enabled plugins during startup.
The file pluginsManager.txt lists all enabled plugins.

Plugins can override any class, method or function in Leo’s core, the files in
Leo’s core subdirectory (the files derived from LeoPy.leo). Besides altering
Leo’s core, plugins can register functions called hooks that Leo calls at
various times during Leo’s execution. Events that trigger hooks include key
pressed events, screen drawing events, node selection events and many others.
When importing a plugin, Leo will call the top-level init() function if it
exists. This function should register the plugin’s hooks by calling
leoPlugins.registerHandler.

For full details about hooks and events see ``Chapter 13: Writing Plugins``, in
``Leo’s Users Guide``. The file ``leoPlugins.leo`` contains all plugins that are
presently distributed with Leo; studying these plugins is a good way of learning
to write your own plugins.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20050917092557">Leo 4.3.3 final                 September 17, 2005

Leo 4.3.3 fixes several bugs reported in Leo 4.3.2 final in the last several days.

To learn about Leo, see: http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of 4.3.3 (and 4.3.2)
-----------------------------------

- Improved Leo's documentation:
    - A tutorial introduction to Leo:
      http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html
    - A 5-minute guide to programming with Leo:
      http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html#quick-start-for-programmers

- The new rst3 plugin creates .html and .tex files from reStructuredText
  embedded in Leo files. Any node of the source outline may contain options for
  the rst3 plugin, which makes this plugin much more useful and flexible than
  the previous rst plugins. All of Leo's documentation was created using this
  plugin from sources in LeoDocs.leo. For full documentation for rst3 see:
  http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/rstplugin3.html.

- The spellpyx (spell checking) plugin is now much easier to use.

- The vim and openWith plugins now use Python's subprocess module if it is present.
 
- Improved the Pretty Printing command.

- The usual assortment of bug fixes.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050917092557.1">Here is a summary of the changes:

- General:  All chapters created with rst3 plugin.  This ensures a uniform look.  The source is in LeoDocs.leo.  Removed all references to older versions of Leo, except when discussing old file formats in the Appendices.  Corrected all text so it discusses present version.

- rst3 plugin itself:  Correct bug that caused chapters to be formatted differently when processing multiple @rst trees.  

- rst3 button in LeoDocs.leo:  The script first looks *up* the tree, looking for an @rst node.  If found, it processes just that tree.  If not found, it processes all @rst nodes *below* the originally selected node.  The button is now much more convenient to use.

- Preface: Shorter, no history.  No longer a dead end.

- What People are Saying About Leo: No longer a dead end.

- FAQ: Reorganized, simplified, revised.  Added entries for running Leo in a console window and debugging docutils.  Improved entry for using cvs.

- Chapter 1: Installation: Now the first chapter.  Revised.

- Chapter 2: Tutorial: Completely rewritten.  Like Python's tutorial, this chapter contains everything a beginner needs to understand and use Leo.  The `Quickstart for programmers` section is the heart of this chapter.  All terms used have links either to their definition in the tutorial or in the Glossary.  Newbies should be able to digest this chapter easily.  This chapter should make Leo comprehensible to many more people.

- Chapter 3: Using Outlines: Revised per general remarks above.

- Chapter 4: Writing Programs in Leo.  Completely rewritten.  The old chapter was an embarrassment. The new chapter is a reference guide, properly organized as such.  The introduction warns newbies away.

- Chapter 5: Using Leo's Commands.  'Minor' revisions and corrections create a substantially better result.

- Chapter 6: Leo and literate programming: Reformatting helps.  New words about rST markup and other improvements over traditional LP.

- Chapter 7: Scripting Leo with Python: Rewritten, simplified, updated and corrected.  The sources in LeoDocs.leo are directly executable.  rST sources use literal blocks instead of code-blocks so that the sources are simplified. (Important when executing examples).  Properly discusses positions, including 'supremely important' section on copying positions.

- Chapter 8: Customizing Leo.  Heavily revised.  Discusses leoSettings.leo, not leoConfig.txt.  Security warnings are more reasonable.  Section on script buttons. Rewrote section on uA's (Adding extensible attributes to nodes and .leo files).

- Chapter 9: History of Leo.  Rewritten.  Much shorter and more useful.  Discusses the major milestones, concentrating on explaining the major differences between versions.  Gone are details of how discoveries came to be.  They are in LeoPostings.leo, which will be included in the distribution.

- Chapter 10: Theory of Operation.  Largely rewritten.  Discusses positions properly.  Omits discussion of how clones were implemented before 4.2.

- Chapter 11: White Papers.  A new chapter.  This is a slightly-edited version of writing that had been buried in the appendices.

- Appendices.  Heavily revised and reformatted.  Rewrote sections on file formats.

- Glossary: A separate chapter.  All terms have links to their definition.  All definitions are rST targets so other chapters may refer to them.  Added several new entries.

<t tx="ekr.20050917092557.9">See http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/rstplugin3.html for full documentation
of this plugin.

The rst3 plugin creates output files from Leo outlines containing
reStructuredText (rST) ReStructuredText is a simple and powerful text formatting
markup language. Outlines are a natural way to organize rST (or any text).

This plugin adds the Write Restructured Text command to Leo's Edit menu. The
Write Restructured Text command searches the selected outline looking for rst
root nodes whose headline have the form @rst &lt;filename&gt;. The plugin then creates
the named file in various ways depending which rst3 options are in effect.

By default, the rst3 plugin creates rST headings automatically from outlines, so
the higher-level nodes in the outline correspond to higher-level sections in the
output. Creating rST headings automatically relieves you from one of the most
tedious chores in creating rST markup.

To use this plugin effectively, Python's docutils module must be installed. The
rst3 plugin will use the SilverCity syntax coloring package if it installed.

This plugin sends .htm, .html or .tex files to the docutils module for further
processing. Docutils generates HTML files or LaTeX files depending on the file's
extension. HTML files generated by docutils refer to three .css (cascading style
sheet) files that should exist in the same directory as the generated HTML file.
You can control the formatting of the HTML file by altering these .css files.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050917092557.10">This plugin now allows quotes within words, but strips quotes and other cruft
from the beginning and end of words. As a result, using the spellpyx spell

Leo's extensions folder now contains aspell23.pyd and aspell24.pyd. These are
Python dll's compiled for Python 2.3 and 2.4 respectively. You must rename one
of these files to be aspell.pyd and move aspell.pyd to the aspell folder. For
more details, see the installation nodes in the docstring for the spellpyx
plugin.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050917092557.11">These plugins now use Python's subprocess module if it is present. The
subprocess module comes standard with Python 2.4. For Linux systems, Leo will
use subprocess.py in Leo's extensions folder if necessary.

For Windows systems you can install Python's subprocess module in Python 2.2 or
2.3 as follows:
    
    - Go to http://www.effbot.org/downloads/#subprocess

    - Download and execute one of the following installers, depending on your version of Python:
        subprocess-0.1-20041012.win32-py2.3.exe 
        subprocess-0.1-20041012.win32-py2.2.exe

Leo 4.4 a4 introduces the 'Newer World Order' for redrawing the screen,
corrects numerous bugs in the 4.4 code base, and introduces several new features.

You should be able to use this version safely. There are no known serious bugs,
but several minibuffer commands are not ready for prime time. All the major
features of 4.4 are in place.

To learn about Leo, see: http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.4:
----------------------------------
- An Emacs-like mini-buffer: you can now execute any command by typing its long
name. Support for tab completion.

- A tabbed log pane. The Find and Spell Check commands now use tabs instead of
dialogs, making those commands much easier to use. Plugins or scripts can easily
create new tabs. The Completion tab shows possible typing completions.

- Support for almost all commands in the Emacs Cmds menu, including cursor
and screen movement, basic character, word and paragraph manipulation, and
commands to manipulate buffers, the kill ring, regions and rectangles.

- Per-pane key bindings. You can bind shortcuts to multiple commands depending
on which of Leo's panes presently has focus. For example, you can use arrow keys
to move nodes in the outline pane, while retaining their defaults in Leo's body
pane. Per-pane key bindings are essential for mouseless Leo.

- @command nodes create minibuffer commands. You can bind key shortcuts to
@button and @command nodes.

- A rewrite of Leo's keystroke handling. In particular, Leo handles key events
immediately rather than queuing them for idle time.

- Leo recovers from crashes much more reliably than in any previous version.

- Leo updates the screen immediately rather than waiting for idle time.
This 'Newer World Order' simplifies the code and improves performance.

Known bugs in Leo 4.4a4
-----------------------
- Several minibuffer commands do not work.  See the release notes for details.

Coming in later releases of Leo 4.4:
------------------------------------
- An auto-complete command that shows class members in the Completion tab.

- More support for mouseless Leo. There will be commands to manipulate all
aspects of Leo using commands, so your fingers will never have to leave the
keyboard.

- Support for Vim and other 'plain-key' input modes.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051028051444.1">Here are the default bindings relating to the minibuffer. Any of
these may be changed by changing @shortcuts nodes in leoSettings.leo.

Alt-x: Just like Emacs: starts minibuffer. The prompt is 'full-command' Type a
full command name, then hit &lt;Return&gt; to execute the command. Tab completion
works, but not for file names.

Alt-c: Like Emacs Control-C: (Ctrl-C conflicts with XP cut). starts minibuffer.
The prompt is 'quick-command'. This mode is not completed, but stuff like
`Ctrl-C r` and `Ctrl r r` do work.

Alt-u: Like Emacs Ctrl-u: (Ctrl-u conflicts with move-outline-up). Add a repeat
count for later command. Ctrl-u 999 a adds 999 a's, but many features remain
unfinished.

Ctrl-g: Just like Emacs Ctrl-g: Closes the mini-buffer.

The @bool useMinibuffer setting in leoSettings.leo just controls whether the
minibuffer is visible. The minibuffer exists (and you can type into it) even if
it isn't visible! You can use the show-mini-buffer, hide-mini-buffer and
toggle-mini-buffer commands to show or hide the minibuffer.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051028051444.2">The most important new features of Leo 4.4 have to do with key bindings.

See the children of this node for details.


</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051028051444.4"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20051028051444.5">1. The minibuffer exists regardless of this setting, but will not be shown
   initially if it is False.

2. Hiding the minibuffer does not change any bindings or the operation of Leo in
   any other way. Therefore, if you do hide the minibuffer initially, and never
   want to use it, you should not bind shortcuts to any commands that use the
   minibuffer.

3. You can execute the show-mini-buffer, hide-mini-buffer and toggle-mini-buffer
   commands (or any other minibuffer command!) if the minibuffer is hidden.
   Indeed, the following will work even if the minibuffer is hidden.

       &lt;alt-x&gt;show-mini-buffer&lt;return&gt;</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051028051444.6">This options controls whether Leo creates a Cmds menu.

This menu is not ready yet, though nothing bad happens if this option is True.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051028051444.7">http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3355954

'body_text_selection_background_color'  Default is 'Gray80'
'body_text_selection_foreground_color'  Default is 'white'</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051028051444.8">- The contract-and-go-right command moves to the parent node and collapses the
parent node.

- The goto-first-sibling and goto-last-sibling commands allow rapid movement
through an ouline without collapsing nodes.

- The print-bindings and print-commands show what commands exist and what keys
are bound to them.

- The help command gives a brief quick start introduction to Leo's Emacs-like
features.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051028051444.9"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20051028051444.10">Leo maintains the following dictionaries.  As usual, k refers to c.keyHandler:

- c.keyHandler.registerCommand can be called from scripts to register new alt-x
  commands. It probably won't work from plugins yet.

New dictionaries and methods make it easier to customize and extend Leo:

- c.commandsDict describes all commands. Keys are full Emacs command names;
values are functions f.

- k.inverseCommandsDict: keys are f.__name__, values are emacs command names.

- k.leoCallbackDict: keys are leoCallback functions, values are called
functions.

- k.bindingsDict: keys are shortcuts, values are g.bunches with the following
    members: func, name, warningGiven, fromMenu.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051028051444.11">The following helper functions make it easy to discover the binding presently in
effect for a command:

- k.getShortcutForCommandName(self,commandName) returns the shortcut given
  f.__name__.

- k.getShortcutForCommand(self,f) returns the shortcut for f.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051028051444.12">@nocolor

c.keyHandlerregisterCommand (self,commandName,shortcut,func)

This function make the func available as a minibuffer command, and optionally
binds a shortcut to func. You can wrap any method in a function, so the
restriction to functions is not significant.

Here is an example take from an @button node::

@color

k = c.keyHandler

def f (event):
    g.es_print('Hello',color='purple')

k.registerCommand('print-hello','Alt-Ctrl-Shift-p',f)
k.registerCommand('print-hello2',None,f)</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051028051444.13">The following bugs exist in 4.3 final.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051028051444.14">This makes it much harder to hang Leo after taking an exception. Leo 4.4a1 is
*much* more robust than Leo 4.3 final in this regard.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051028051444.15">Added big kludge to menu.createMenuEntries so that f.OnCut/Copy/PasteFromMenu get called
**only** when explicitly selected from the menu (rather than from a shortcut).
This allows the code in cut/copy/paste-text to be different as needed.

Users can override the shortcut by assigning shortcuts to cut/copy/paste-text commands.
The shortcut will appear in the menu, but does **not** get bound to c.frame.menu.

This is an essential step in solving the infamous Control-V problem.
The code appears to work properly on XP.  Not tested other places.

This is the last best hope to solve this problem: the code interacts as little as possible with Tk.</t>

The scripting plugin has been improved as follows:

1. You can bind shortcuts in @button nodes.  Like this:

@button name @key=shortcut

This binds the shortcut to the script in the script button.  The button's name is 'name', but you can see the full headline in the status line when you move the mouse over the button.  This is a clean and simple way of discovering the shortcut.

2. You can create your own minibuffer commands with @command nodes.

A node whose headline has the form:

@command command-name

a new minibuffer command whose name is 'command-name'.

A node whose headline has the form:

@command command-name @key=shortcut

creates new minibuffer command and binds shortcut to it.

3.  The scripting plugin no longer contains the 'bindLate' code-level option.  The scripts for all @button or @command nodes are computed 'dynamically', that is, when the button is pushed or the command is executed from the minibuffer.  This is the most useful way, and the most intuitive.

Previously, scripts for @button nodes were never dynamic, while scripts in @button nodes created by the 'Script button' button were dynamic only if bindLate was True.  You could call this a bug: it was unhelpful, annoying and confusing.

4. The scripting plugin no longer prints an 'end of script' message.  This allows scripts to select tabs in the log pane</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051028051616.172">@color

# Plugins and scripts can easily create new tabs in the log panel.
# Important: you can run any of these examples using the 'Run Script' button.

# To create a tab named "Test" or make it visible if it already exists:
 
c.frame.log.selectTab('Test')

# When first created, a tab contains a text widget.
# To write to this widget, add the tabName argument to g.es:

g.es('Test',color='blue',tabName='Test')

# Plugins and scripts can easily replace the default Text widget with other Tk widgets.
# c.frame.log.tabFrame contains the Tk.Frame that contains all the other widgets of the frame.
# c.frame.log.logCtrl contains the Tk.Text widget that is initially the only widget in this frame.
# So to remove this text widget just do:
    
c.frame.log.logCtrl.pack_forget()

# Now you can pack any other widgets into c.frame.log.tabFrame.

import Tkinter as Tk ; log = c.frame.log
log.selectTab('Test')
log.logCtrl.pack_forget()
f = Tk.Frame(log.tabFrame,bg='red',height='1inch',width='2inch')
f.pack(side='left',expand=0,fill='none')</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051028051616.299">Leo can optionally generate matching brackets depending on the setting:

@bool autocomplete-brackets = TrueOrFalse

If True, Leo will immediately type the corresponding closing bracket whenever
you type a '(', '[' or '{' character. You can use the forward-char command to
move past the closing bracket, and Leo will move past any closing bracket if you
type the closing bracket with the cursor just to the left of a closing bracket.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051028061322">**Important**: The print-bindings and print-commands commands (new in a1) show
what commands exist and what keys are bound to them.

- The help command tells how to use the minibuffer.

- The show-minibuffer, hide-minibuffer and toggle-mini-buffer commands show and hide the minibuffer.

It *is* possible to execute these command even if the minibuffer isn't presently
visible. For example, typing 

&lt;alt-x&gt;toggle-mini-buffer&lt;return&gt;

should always work.

- The open-find-tab command opens the Find tab. The Find tab replaces the old
Find panel. The Find panel is deprecated.

- The open-spell-tab command opens the Spell-checking tab.

- The show-colors command creates the 'Colors' tab in the log pane. This tab allows you to
experiment with picking fonts.

- The show-fonts command creates the 'Fonts' tab in the log pane. This tab allows you to
experiment with picking colors.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051101161405">At the bottom of Leo's window you will now see an area labeled the mini-buffer.
You can't type in it directly, you activate the buffer by typing Alt-x or Alt-c.
Typing Alt-x takes you to 'full-command' mode. Type the full name of a command,
followed by a 'return'. 

- To get help, type Alt-x help.
- For a list of commands, type Alt-x print-commands.
- For a list of present key bindings, type Alt-x print-bindings.
- To leave the mini-buffer at any time type Ctrl-g.

Note: you can redefine any of these keys as you wish.

Important: you can execute any of Leo's 'legacy' commands from the mini-buffer.
For example, Alt-x about-leo or Alt-x open-find-dialog. Note: Leo's Find
*dialog* is deprecated. You will find it much more convenient to use Leo's new
Find *tab*. Use the open-find-tab command.

You can use tab-completion in the minibuffer to cycle through the list of
commands that start with what is in the buffer. Typing backspace takes you back
to the what you previously typed (less on character.) The 'Completion' tab shows
all possible completions. This tab appears automatically when you type a tab in
the minibuffer.

The mini-buffer reduces the need for shortcuts dramatically. For example, none
of Leo's import commands need a shortcut because it is easy enough to execute
them from the minibuffer. In particular, executing commands from the minibuffer
is much easier than executing commands by hand from a menu. </t>
<t tx="ekr.20051101161405.1">leoSettings.leo contains one functional @shortcuts node and one disabled
@@shortcuts node. These node contain entries for every command.

You can assign key shortcuts to any command, as discussed in the comments in
that file. You can leave the nodes as they are, use them as base for
modifications, or roll your own. You should define a binding for every function,
even if that binding is 'None'. If you don't, Leo will issue a warning.

Leo now supports per-pane bindings.  Bindings of the form:

command-name ! pane = shortcut

bind the shortcut to the command only withing a single pane. The possible values
for 'pane' are:

pane    affected panes
----    --------------
all     body,log,tree
body    body
log     log
mini    minibuffer
text    body,log
tree    tree</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051101161405.2">The scripting plugin has been improved in two ways:

1. You can specify key bindings in @button nodes as follows:

@button name @key=shortcut

This binds the shortcut to the script in the script button. The button's name is
'name', but you can see the full headline in the status line when you move the
mouse over the button.

2. You can create new minibuffer commands with @command nodes:

@command name @key=shortcut

This creates a new minibuffer command and binds shortcut to it.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051101161405.3">Abbreviations may not work at present. A new kind of abbreviation is presently
hard coded in add_ekr_altx_commands in leoKeys.py. For example, one ekr-shortcut
is: 'f', which is bound to leo-find-panel. Typing Alt-x f Return executes
leo-find-panel. These may be quicker than Emacs abbreviations, or not.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051101161949"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20051101162123">These 'hard-coded' bindings are no longer needed and interfere with per-pane bindings.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051101162123.1">- The open-find-tab command opens the Find tab.

- The open-spell-tab command opens the Spell-checking tab.

The Find and Spell *tabs* replace the corresponding legacy *dialogs*. Using tabs
eliminates previous problems with dialogs obscuring Leo's main window.

Two essential components of the settings dialog now are implemented in the tabbed log:

- The show-colors command creates the 'Colors' tab in the log pane.

- The show-fonts command creates the 'Fonts' tab in the log pane.

These two tabs allow you to pick color or font names without using the @settings dialog.

Important: scripts and plugins can easily create new tabs in the Log pane. See
Chapter 7 of the Users Guide for details.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051101162947">Leo's core now supports tabs in the log pane.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051101163145">Leo 4.4a2 contains a large number of code-level improvements--some very
significant. For full details, see the (Projects) section of LeoPy.leo.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051101163404">The following bugs existed in the 4.4a1 code base and have now been fixed:

- The spelling settings in leoSettings.leo replace the settings in spellpyx.ini.

- You can specify the background of tabs using the following pattern::

    @color log_pane_XXX_tab_background_color = aColor

For example::

    @color log_pane_Find_tab_background_color = #d6c7d3

- The @bool autocomplete-brackets setting controls whether Leo types a matching
closing bracket immediately when you type '(', '[' or '{'.</t>

This code was contributed by Roger Erens.

When the Clone Find All checkbox is checked, the Find All command creates a new
root node called Found: &lt;your search pattern&gt;

This node contains clones of the nodes found by the Find All command. It is your
own responsibility to navigate to this new node and to clean it up when it's no
longer needed.</t>

- The focusIn/Out trace is a great tool.

- doTabCompletion now calls w.update before calling bodyWantsFocus.

- Eliminated w.update from g.app.gui.set_focus.  It is now called only in
those places where it is truly essential, such as in k.doTabCompletion and
wherever else it might be required.

- Pmw.Notebook does a *lot* when it switches panes (e.g., the _layout method)
and potentially any of the things it does could result in focus shifting to
widget. Rather than trying to make sense of it all, Leo will simply call
w.update as necessary to force completion of the Pmw.Notebook work before trying
to set focus.</t>

Using JythonShell
###########################

This chapter describes how to use the Jython Shell created by LeoUser.

.. .. contents::</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203084850.1">.. rST links used in this document...</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203085709">



</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203085709.1">- Up-Down Arrow moves the selection up or down.
- Tab inserts the current selection.

The completion list shows the best prefix entered after the '.'
Any other key withdraws the autocompleter.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203085709.2">Enter
    Processes the current line from the prompt to the end,
    regardless of where the cursor is.

Ctrl Enter
    This keystroke has two meanings:

    1. process the current line with a ':' appended to the end of it,
       regardless of where the cursor is.
       This is the behavior if there is character data on the line.

    2. If the line is pure whitespace, then the line is interpreted as a '' string with a length of 0.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203085709.3">Executing will dynamically expand a prefix to matching
words already entered within the interpreter.  For example:
cactus
cac( keystroke ) will expand cac to cactus.
This will cycle through all matches to cac within the buffer upon repeated execution.

Ctrl A 
    Moves current position to the end of the prompt.

Ctrl E
    Moves current position to the end of the line.

Ctrl K
    Removes all text from current position to end of the line.

Ctrl N
    Start typing, and then use this keystroke to search downwards only through
    the history items that match what you've typed so far. If you use this
    keystroke at a blank prompt, they just behave like normal arrow keys.

Ctrl P
    Start typing, and then use this keystroke to search upwards through only the
    history items that match what you ve typed so far. If you use this keystroke
    at a blank prompt, they just behave like normal arrow keys.

Ctrl R
    Opens a search prompt. Begin typing and the system searches your history for
    lines that contain what you ve typed so far, completing as much as it can.

Ctrl T
    Places triple quotes around the text on the current line.

Ctrl Z
    Suppresses the current output for the duration of the execution statement.
    This is useful in cases where there is a tremendous amount of output
    occurring and the user decides that he no longer wishes to see all of it. For
    gigantic outputs, this can be a shell saver.

Delete
    Removes all text from the prompt to the end of the line.

Down
    Moves the current line down one item in the history.
    By moving, this means the current line is replaced with history item.

Up
    Moves the current line up one item in the history
    By moving, this means the current line is replaced with history item.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203085709.4">Typing a reference name followed by a ? will create a object view which gives
the user a variety of information about the Object in question. Example::

    a = 'meoooowwww'
    a? # Upon Enter, a panel will appear below showing Object information.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203090220">Typing ! at the command prompt followed by the system command you wish to
execute will start the command as a process and return a JPID for the process
that can be manipulated by the magic command set.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203090220.1">Entering one of the following commands will cause its
corresponding command to execute:</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203090220.2">JPIDs are not PIDs of the OS. They are a system by which the JythonShell can
keep track of Processes created by it, and means by which the user can
manipulate those Processes.

The CWD does not indicate what the process is working in. It is intended to
function with the Magic Commands. This system does not interoperate with
java.io.File or Jython open. To achieve interoperability the user should use the
magic command of the form::

    %cwd reference

This will place a java.io.File in the reference. The File instance is a copy of
the CWD File and will allow the user to open, write, create, close streams and
such in the JythonShell's CWD</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203094826">``%alias`` *anAlias* defines alias name as an alias for cmd.
Afterwards, typing alias name params will execute the system command cmd params (from your
underlying operating system).
Aliases have lower precedence than magic functions and Python normal variables,
so if foo is both a Python variable and an alias, the alias can not be executed until you remove the Python using ``del foo``.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203094826.1">Toggles autocalling off and on.
Autocalling is the ability to do something like::

    dir a

instead of dir( a ).</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203094826.2">Toggles autoindenting off and on.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203095113">Runs a method/function in a background thread.
For example::

    %bg doit()

This executes doit in a thread.
The status of the operation can be seen by looking at the jobs object::

    jobs.status()  #Prints the status of the jobs.

Alternatively you can access the status like so::

    jobs[jobnumber].result

jobnumber is printed out when the method/function is about to execute.
The result will be the return value of the method/function or it will tell you the job isn't finished yet.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203095113.1">Changes the current working directory of the Jython Shell.
``..`` signifies the parent directory.
Absolute and relative paths are allowed.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203095113.2">Destroys all JPIDs.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203095113.3">Clears the shell of all text and starts over with a fresh prompt.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203095113.4">Shows the current working directory of the Jython Shell.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203095113.5">Sets the reference to a java.io.File instance representing the current directory.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203095437">Deserialize an Object stored on disk into the reference.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203095437.1">Same as %edit.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203095437.2">Brings up the Jython Shell editor and executes the resulting code.

This command allows you to conveniently edit multi-line code right in your JythonShell session.
If called without arguments,
``%edit`` opens up an empty editor with a temporary file and will execute the contents of this file when you close it
(don t forget to save it!).
Options:

-p
    Calls the editor with the same data as the previous time it was used,
    regardless of how long ago (in your current session) it was.

-x
    Suppresses execution of the edited code upon exit.
    This is mainly useful if you are editing programs which need to be called with command line arguments,
    which you can then do using %run.

If args are given, the following possibilities exist:

- The arguments are numbers or pairs of colon-separated numbers, e.g., ``1 4:8 9``.
  These are interpreted as lines of previous input to be loaded into the editor.
  The syntax is the same of the %macro command.

- If the argument doesn't start with a number,
  it is evaluated as a variable and its contents loaded into the editor.
  You can thus edit any string which contains python code (including the result of previous edits).</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203095437.3">Prints all environment variables.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203095437.4">Prints all or part of the history.
If given, the ``-n`` argument signifies that line numbers should not be printed out.

%hist [ -n ] 
    Prints the total history or the last 40 items in it.

%hist [ -n ] n1
    Prints the last n1 items in the history.

%hist [ -n ] n1 n2
    Prints the items from index n1 to index n2.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203095437.5">Destroys JPID n.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203095437.6">Shows the contents of the current working directory.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203095437.7">Shows a java array of File instances.  For example::

    %ls a # a now holds a java array of File instances</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203100230">Returns the current available set of magic commands.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203100230.1">Defines a macro that can be executed by using the name given.  For example::

    %macro macex 9:10 11 12:13 4

creates a macro called macex and puts line 9-10, 11 12-13 and 4 from the history into it
Hence entering macex and typing enter will cause those lines to rexecute.

To see the contents of the macro type: ``print macroname``.
To remove a macro type: ``del macroname``.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203100230.2">%magic
    Prints out the description of the magic commands.

%magic %magiccommandname
    Prints the usage/description of the given magic command.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203100230.3">Same as 'print'.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203100230.4">%pdb
    Starts the Pdb debugger.

%pdb filename

    Runs the file under Pdb in the shell.

%pdb [on|1|off|0 ]
    Toggles automatic startup of Pdb on an exception.  Examples::

        %pdb on  --&gt; now on
        %pdb off --&gt; now off
        %pdb 1 --&gt; now on
        %pdb 0 --&gt; now off</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203100230.5">Prints out the doc string of the passed in object if one can be found, otherwise does nothing.

The object may be a module, a method, an object, etc.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203100230.6">Attempts to locate the source file of the passed in object
and displays the contents of the source in the shell.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203100230.7">An alias for the ? object viewer syntax.
If the references is valid, a widget containing info on the reference will appear.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203100230.8">Executes a statement entered on the same line in the profile module.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203100230.9">%ps
    Prints out all JPID's the JythonShell has collected.

%ps aReference
    Puts a java Set of Processes in the reference.  For example:

        %ps a #a now holds a Set of Processes.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203100230.10">Repeats the last input.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203100930.1">%rehash
    Updates the alias table with all entries in $PATH.
    This command does **not** check execute permissions or whether the contents of $PATH are truly files
    (instead of directories or something else).

%rehashx
    Updates the alias table with all executable files in $PATH.
    This command **does** explicitly check that every entry in $PATH is a file, so it is slower than %rehash.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203100930.2">Resets the namespace by removing all names defined by the user.
Input/Output history remain in case you need them.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203100930.3">Runs the named file inside IPython as a program. Options:

-n:
    Suppresses setting ``__name__`` to ``__main__``.
    Instead, sets ``__name__`` to the file's name without
    extension (as Python does under import).

    This allows running scripts and reloading the definitions in them without calling code protected by::

        if __name__ == __main__:

-i:
    Runs the file in JythonShell's namespace instead of an empty one.
    This is useful if you are experimenting with code written in a text editor which
    depends on variables defined interactively.

-t:
    Prints timing information at the end of the run.

-N n:
    If -t is given this option indicates how many times you want the script to run.
    ``n`` must be an integer.
    The final timing report will include total and per run results.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203100930.4">This command uses the same syntax as %macro for line extraction, but instead
of creating a macro it saves the resulting string to file whose name is
given. It ensures the filename ends with a .py extension, and it asks for
confirmation before overwriting existing files.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203100930.6">Runs the given command using ``command.getoutput()``
and updates the user's interactive namespace with a variable called varname
containing the value of the call.
Your command can contain shell wildcards, pipes, etc.
The ``=`` is mandatory, and the variable name must be a valid Python identifier.
Options:

-l:
    List output. Splits the output on newlines into a list before
    assigning it to the given variable. By default the output is stored as a
    single string.

-v:
    Verbose. Prints the contents of the variable.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203100930.7">%see n
    Shows any output JPID n has collected.

%see n aReference
    Places any output JPID n has collected in the reference.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203101658">Sends the reference as input to JPID n.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203101658.1">Saves the object referenced by reference as a serialized Object.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203101658.2">Places the reference into the editor if the reference is a JComponent subclass.
Useful for quick gazing of what a Swing component looks like.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203101658.3">Runs the given command using commands.getoutput(), and returns the result formatted as a list (split on).
The output is stored in ipython's regular output cache Out[N] and in the N automatic variables.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203101828">Shows the threads running and the state they are in.
Selecting a thread shows the thread's stack.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203101828.1">Removes the given alias.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203101828.2">Loads data from a url into a reference.  For example::

    %url a http://python.org

take the data at ``http://python.org`` and places it in ref.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203101828.3">Suspends the JythonShell until JPID n has finished.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203101828.4">Prints the list of identifiers that have been defined interactively.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203101828.5">Returns a sorted list of all interactive variables.
If arguments are given, only variables of types matching these arguments are returned.
Examples::

    %who_ls
    %who_ls str int  #this prints out variables whose type is str and int</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203101828.6">Prints a table of identifiers that have been defined interactively.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203101828.7">Transforms reference ref2 with the stylesheet in ref1 putting the result in ref3.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20051205091625">- The abbreviation and buffer commands are not ready yet.

- repeat-complex-command does not work.

- Moving the cursor when the 'mark' has been defined does not expand the visibly
selected text.

- Yanking and killing have not been well tested.

- C-u 5 &lt;return&gt; works but is not undone properly. Also, the kill-line command
does not work as in Emacs.

- Many new commands must be generalized to handle the more complex environment
Leo offers. For example, search commands must be told whether to limit the
search a single node, or a node or and its descendants, or the entire outline.
We need a set-variable command that sets a (Python) variable using an
emacs-style variable name.

- The notion of the 'point' must be expanded so it indicates a node as well as
text location.
    
- New commands are needed to support 'mouseless-Leo'. The user must be able to
drive all dialogs from the keyboard, or to get the same effect without using a
dialog at all. Examples: dismiss-top-dialog, scroll-outline-up/down. We also
need commands to change focus and to manage menus. Examples: focus-in-body,
focus-in-tree, etc, activate-edit-menu, etc.</t>

This release completes the last major features of Leo 4.4:

- User-specified key-binding modes.
- Support for multiple key-bindings for individual minibuffer commands.

This will be the last alpha version of Leo 4.4. Beta 1 is coming in about a
week. You should be able to use this version safely; there are no known serious
bugs.

To learn about Leo, see: http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.4:
----------------------------------
- An Emacs-like mini-buffer: you can now execute any command by typing its long
name. Support for tab completion.

- A tabbed log pane. The Find and Spell Check commands now use tabs instead of
dialogs, making those commands much easier to use. Plugins or scripts can easily
create new tabs. The Completion tab shows possible typing completions.

- Support for most commands in the Emacs Cmds menu, including cursor and screen
movement, basic character, word and paragraph manipulation, and commands to
manipulate buffers, the kill ring, regions and rectangles.

- Per-pane key bindings. You can bind shortcuts to multiple commands depending
on which of Leo's panes presently has focus. For example, you can use arrow keys
to move nodes in the outline pane, while retaining their defaults in Leo's body
pane.

- User-specified key-binding modes. This feature makes it possible to emulate all
aspects of Emacs and Vim as far as key bindings are concerned.

- @command nodes create minibuffer commands. You can bind key shortcuts to
@button and @command nodes.

- Leo recovers from crashes much more reliably than in any previous version.

- Leo handles keystrokes and updates the screen immediately rather than waiting
for idle time.</t>

completes the editing of a headline, and ch is always '\r', regardless of
platform.

What I did:

- atFile.readError deletes root's entire subtree.
- atFile.read only warns about unvisited node if there is no error.

And a recent bug: clicking in the expand/contract box didn't save the headline.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051219150602.81">The problem was caused by the recent change to g.app.gui.setTextSelection.

<t tx="ekr.20051219150602.105">Leo now supports the following commands, shown below with their present bindings:

back-char ! text = LtArrow
back-char-extend-selection ! text = Shift-LtArrow
back-paragraph ! text = Alt-braceleft 
back-paragraph-extend-selection ! text = Alt-Shift-braceleft
back-sentence ! text = Alt-a 
back-sentence-extend-selection  = None
back-word ! text = Alt-b  # No conflict   
back-word-extend-selection  ! text = Alt-Shift-b
beginning-of-buffer ! text = Alt-less # Note: same as Alt-Shift-less
beginning-of-buffer-extend-selection  = None
beginning-of-line ! text = Ctrl-a
beginning-of-line-extend-selection = None
exchange-point-mark = None
forward-char ! text = RtArrow
forward-char-extend-selection ! text = Shift-RtArrow
forward-paragraph ! text = Alt-braceright
forward-paragraph-extend-selection ! text = Alt-Shift-braceright
forward-sentence ! text = Alt-e
forward-sentence-extend-selection ! text = Alt-Shift-e
forward-word ! text = Alt-f
forward-word-extend-selection ! text = Alt-Shift-f
next-line ! text = DnArrow
next-line-extend-selection  ! text = Shift-DnArrow
previous-line ! text = Uparrow
previous-line-extend-selection ! text = Shift-UpArrow

The -extend-selection variants move the cursor and also extend the selection
from the insert point in the indicated direction. As usual exchange-point-mark
switches the insert point from one side of the selection to the other: which
side of the selection the insert point is on does make a difference.

I also added three commands that implement so-called 'extend mode':

clear-extend-mode = None
set-extend-mode = None
toggle-extend-mode = None

When extend mode is on (it is off at first), all cursor movement commands listed
above extend the selection. Very handy. Thanks to Brian for this suggestion.

This is the start of mouseless Leo. For the first time all the common Emacs
cursor-movement commands exist. These commands should work in any text widget.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20060111192108">A **dangerous** delete is a deletion of a node so that all the data in the node is deleted *everywhere* in an outline.  The data is gone, to be retrieved only via undo or via backups.  It may not be obvious which deletes are dangerous in an outline containing clones.  Happily, there is a very simple rule of thumb::

    Deleting a non-cloned node is *always* dangerous.
    Deleting a cloned node is *never* dangerous.

We could also consider a delete to be dangerous **if it results in a node being omitted from a derived file.**  This can happen as follows.  Suppose we have the following outline (As usual, A' indicates that A is marked with a clone mark)::

    - @thin spam.py
        - A'
            - B
    - Projects
        - A'
            - B

Now suppose we clone B, and move the clone so the tree looks like this::

    - @thin spam.py
        - A'
            - B'
    - Projects
        - A'
            - B'
        - B'

If (maybe much later), we eliminate B' as a child of A will get::

    - @thin spam.py
        - A'
    - Projects
        - A'
        - B

B has not been destroyed, but B is gone from @thin spam.py! So in this sense deleting a clone node can also be called dangerous.</t>

The code is stable; there are no known serious bugs. Some features are
incomplete.

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.4:
--------------------------
- An Emacs-like mini-buffer: you can now execute any command by typing its long
name, with tab completion.

- Many new commands, including cursor and screen movement, basic character, word
and paragraph manipulation, and commands to manipulate buffers, the kill ring,
regions and rectangles. You can use Leo without using a mouse.

- Flexible key bindings and input modes. You can emulate the operation of Emacs,
Vim, or any other editor.

- A tabbed log pane. The Find and Spell Check commands now use tabs instead of
dialogs, making those commands much easier to use. Plugins or scripts can easily
create new tabs. The Completion tab shows possible typing completions.

- Dozens of other new features and bug fixes since Leo 4.3.3.

This is logically and practically dubious.
True, a screen redraw shouldn't mess with the focus,

1. c.endUpdate can happen anytime, and it could interfere with other efforts to set focus.

<t tx="ekr.20060206111508.596">A *major* improvement to the tree allocation code:

1.  Use p.key() to as keys to tree.visibleText.
 This greatly speeds up tree.findEditWidget

2. Eliminated the brain-dead requirement that previously-allocated widgets must match the position.
   - The allocation code just gets *any* previously allocated widget.
     This eliminates an n**2 search!
   - The ancient problem was that theId refers to the *window* not its Text widget:
     the *window* must be moved to the right spot.

3. recycleWidgets is simpler and a bit faster.

4. destroyWidgets now works: (the bug was not clearing tree.ids).</t>

- All minibuffer find commands copy the find string from the Find tab into the minibuffer.

- The replace-string command sets up arguments for Tab find. This is different
  from the normal Emacs replace-string command, but it works well in Leo.

- Leo doesn't abort the minibuffer if the command does not exist.
  This is much more convenient.

<t tx="ekr.20060211104746.2">In the new drawing scheme, tree.redraw_now always calls c.endEditing, which
calls tree.onHeadChanged. The effect of this was to reverse the action of
undo/redoNodeContents.

The solution was to change the edit widget directly before calling
tree.redraw_now. To do this, I created the new tree.setHeadline method.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060211104746.12">* Found the reason why focus was *still* sticking in the outline pane:
    - The click handlers must return 'break', not continue.
    - However, OnActivateHeadline must return 'continue' when the headline is active
      so that Tk will handle the click properly.

- UNL does not seem to be causing problems.

- No need to save/restore focus in status line.

- Added several new traces to tkTree class.

* tree.redraw_now now ends editing properly. This fixes lots of bugs. In
particular, it avoid any chance that p.edit_widget won't correspond to the
present position.

- k.masterClickHandler calls tree.OnDeactivate() if there is no callback function.
  This solves most headline focus problems, provided that all panes bind clicks to k.masterClickHandler.

- toggle-active-pane now ends editing properly.

- insert-headline now calls c.editPosition after calling c.endUpdate().</t>

<t tx="ekr.20060212102459.4">All minibuffer search commands, with the exception of the isearch (incremental) commands, simply provide a minibuffer interface to Leo's legacy find commands.  This means that all the powerful features of Leo's legacy commands are available to the minibuffer search commands.

Note: all bindings shown are the default bindings for these commands.  You may change any of these bindings using @shortcuts nodes in leoSettings.leo.

Settings

leoSettings.leo now contains several settings related to the Find tab:

- @bool show_only_find_tab_options = True

When True (recommended), the Find tab does not show the 'Find', 'Change', 'Change, Then Find', 'Find All' and 'Change All' buttons.

- @bool minibufferSearchesShowFindTab = True

When True, Leo shows the Find tab when executing most of the commands discussed below.  It's not necessary for it to be visible, but I think it provides good feedback about what search-with-present-options does.  YMMY.  When True, the sequence Control-F, Control-G is one way to show the Find Tab.

Basic find commands

- The open-find-tab command makes the Find tab visible.  The Find tab does **not** need to be visible to execute any search command discussed below.

- The hide-find-tab commands hides the Find tab, but retains all the present settings.

- The search-with-present-options command (Control-F) prompts for a search string.  Typing the &lt;Return&gt; key puts the search string in the Find tab and executes a search based on all the settings in the Find tab.   This command is my 'workhorse' search command.

- The show-search-options command shows the present search options in the status line.  At present, this command also shows the Find tab.

Search again commands

- The find-tab-find command (F3) is the same as the search-with-present-options command, except that it uses the search string in the find-tab.  This is what I use as my default 'search again' command.

- Similarly, the find-tab-find-previous command (F2) repeats the command specified by the Find tab, but in reverse.

- The find-again command a combination of the search-with-present-options and find-tab-find command.  It is the same as the find-tab-find command if a search pattern other than '&lt;find pattern here&gt;' exists in the Find tab.  Otherwise, the find-again is the same as the search-with-present-options command.

Setting find options

- Several minibuffer commands toggle the checkboxes and radio buttons in the Find tab, and thus affect the operation of the search-with-present-options command. Some may want to bind these commands to keys. Others, will prefer to toggle options in a mode.


Here are the commands that toggle checkboxes: toggle-find-ignore-case-option, toggle-find-in-body-option, toggle-find-in-headline-option, toggle-find-mark-changes-option, toggle-find-mark-finds-option, toggle-find-regex-option, toggle-find-reverse-option, toggle-find-word-option, and toggle-find-wrap-around-option.

Here are the commands that set radio buttons: set-find-everywhere, set-find-node-only, and set-find-suboutline-only.

- The enter-find-options-mode (Ctrl-Shift-F) enters a mode in which you may change all checkboxes and radio buttons in the Find tab with plain keys.  As always, you can use the mode-help (Tab) command to see a list of key bindings in effect for the mode.

Search commands that set options as a side effect

The following commands set an option in the Find tab, then work exactly like the search-with-present-options command.

- The search-backward and search-forward commands set the 'Whole Word' checkbox to False.

- The word-search-backward and word-search-forward set the 'Whole Word' checkbox to True.

- The re-search-forward and re-search-backward set the 'Regexp' checkbox to True.

Find all commands

- The find-all command prints all matches in the log pane.

- The clone-find-all command replaces the previous 'Clone Find' checkbox.  It prints all matches in the log pane, and creates a node at the beginning of the outline containing clones of all nodes containing the 'find' string.  Only one clone is made of each node, regardless of how many clones the node has, or of how many matches are found in each node.

Note: the radio buttons in the Find tab (Entire Outline, Suboutline Only and Node only) control how much of the outline is affected by the find-all and clone-find-all commands.

Search and replace commands

The replace-string prompts for a search string.  Type &lt;Return&gt; to end the search string.  The command will then prompt for the replacement string.  Typing a second &lt;Return&gt; key will place both strings in the Find tab and executes a **find** command, that is, the search-with-present-options command.

So the only difference between the replace-string and search-with-present-options commands is that the replace-string command has the side effect of setting 'change' string in the Find tab.  However, this is an extremely useful side effect, because of the following commands...

- The find-tab-change command (Ctrl-=) replaces the selected text with the 'change' text in the Find tab.

- The find-tab-change-then-find (Ctrl--) replaces the selected text with the 'change' text in the Find tab, then executes the find command again.

The find-tab-find, find-tab-change and find-tab-change-then-find commands can simulate any kind of query-replace command.  **Important**: Leo presently has separate query-replace and query-replace-regex commands, but they are buggy and 'under-powered'.  Fixing these commands has low priority.

- The find-tab-change-all command changes all occurrences of the 'find' text with the 'change' text.  Important: the radio buttons in the Find tab (Entire Outline, Suboutline Only and Node only) control how much of the outline is affected by this command.

Incremental search commands

Leo's incremental search commands are completely separate from Leo's legacy search commands.  At present, incremental search commands do not cross node boundaries: they work only in the body text of single node.

Coming in Leo 4.4b3: the incremental commands will maintain a list of previous matches.  This allows for

a) support for backspace and
b) an incremental-search-again command.

Furthermore, this list makes it easy to detect the end of a wrapped incremental search.

Here is the list of incremental find commands: isearch-backward, isearch-backward-regexp, isearch-forward and
isearch-forward-regexp.'''</t>

Leo 4.4 b2 was broken on some platforms.  Leo 4.4 a6 should fix those problems
forever.  However, only wider distribution will verify that for certain.

Besides fixing the fatal problems with Leo 4.4b2, this version fixes two minor bugs
and adds some new settings in leoSettings.leo.

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.4 b2 and a6:
----------------------------
- Smoother user interface.
- New commands that support mouseless Leo.
- Minibuffer search commands provide all features of Leo's legacy search commands.
- User modes are fully functional; you can create special bindings for the minibuffer.
- New master key and click handlers and improved allocation of screen widgets.

Coming in Leo 4.4b3:
--------------------
- A revived chapters plugin.
- Autocompleter Tab.
- Improved incremental searches.

The highlights of Leo 4.4:
--------------------------
- An Emacs-like mini-buffer: you can now execute any command by typing its long
name, with tab completion.

- Many new commands, including cursor and screen movement, basic character, word
and paragraph manipulation, and commands to manipulate buffers, the kill ring,
regions and rectangles. You can use Leo without using a mouse.

- Flexible key bindings and input modes. You can emulate the operation of Emacs,
Vim, or any other editor.

- A tabbed log pane. The Find and Spell Check commands now use tabs instead of
dialogs, making those commands much easier to use. Plugins or scripts can easily
create new tabs. The Completion tab shows possible typing completions.

- Dozens of other new features and bug fixes since Leo 4.3.3.

<t tx="ekr.20060217071505.1">The new scheme binds to keystrokes, not commands.  This should be as portable
and robust as all previous versions (except b2, which was broken).

- Created k.completeAllBindings, called last in k.makeAllBindings. This binds
all keystrokes in k.bindingsDict to k.masterKeyHandler with an optional stroke
argument. This allows k.masterKeyhandler to dispense with the problematic call
to k.strokeFromEvent. This is all that is really required. 

- Added code to menu.createMenuEntries that clears the accelerator on MacOS for
any key that isn't a control, alt or command key. This solves the recurring
problems with the Return key. The only effect is that the menu won't mention a
binding that is actually in effect, but apparently that cannot be helped.

- Added g.safeCompareStrings, which may, or may not, fix the crasher when
comparing k.abortAllModesKey to the incoming keystroke in k.masterKeyHandler.
It's a bit tricky to test.

- The ignore_caps_lock is no longer functional. Sigh. This depends on knowing
the Caps_Lock bit in key events. I may put this back later, but I can't delay a6
even a minute for this.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20060227102028.111">Typing a period when @language python is in effect starts autocompletion. Typing
'(' during autocompletion shows the calltip. Typing Return or Control-g
(keyboard-quit) exits autocompletion or calltips.

Autocompletion

Autocompletion shows what may follow a period in code. (Actually you can specify
any character using the auto-complete shortcut setting.) For example, after
typing g. Leo will show a list of all the global functions in leoGlobals.py.
Autocompletion works much like tab completion in the minibuffer. Unlike the
minibuffer, the presently selected completion appears directly in the body
pane.

A leading period brings up 'Autocomplete Modules'. (The period goes away.) You
can also get any module by typing its name. If more than 25 items would appear
in the Autocompleter tab, Leo shows only the valid starting characters. At this
point, typing an exclamation mark shows the complete list. Thereafter, typing
further exclamation marks toggles between full and abbreviated modes.

If x is a list 'x.!' shows all its elements, and if x is a Python dictionary,
'x.!' shows x.keys(). For example, 'sys.modules.!' Again, further exclamation
marks toggles between full and abbreviated modes.

During autocompletion, typing a question mark shows the docstring for the
object. For example: 'g.app?' shows the docstring for g.app. This doesn't work
(yet) directly for Python globals, but '__builtin__.f?' does. Example:
'__builtin__.pow?' shows the docstring for pow.

Autocompletion works in the Find tab; you can use &lt;Tab&gt; to cycle through the
choices. The 'Completion' tab appears while you are doing this; the Find tab
reappears once the completion is finished.

Calltips

Calltips appear after you type an open parenthesis in code. Calltips shows the
expected arguments to a function or method. Calltips work for any Python
function or method, including Python's global function. Examples:

a)  'g.toUnicode('  gives 'g.toUnicode(s, encoding, reportErrors=False'
b) 'c.widgetWantsFocusNow' gives 'c.widgetWantsFocusNow(w'
c) 'reduce(' gives 'reduce(function, sequence[, initial]) -&gt; value'

The calltips appear directly in the text and the argument list is highlighted so
you can just type to replace it. The calltips appear also in the status line for
reference after you have started to replace the args.

Options

Both autocompletion and calltips are initially enabled or disabled by the
enable_autocompleter and enable_calltips settings in leoSettings.leo. You may
enable or disable these features at any time with these commands:
enable-auto-completer-command, enable-calltips-command,
disable-auto-completer-command and disable-calltips-command.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20060328171518.119">- onBodyChanged now converts everything to unicode, either directly or by calling g.app.gui.getAllText.

- Replaced all calls to g.safeStringCompare by g.app.gui.getAllText which calls g.toUnicode.

- Converted all shortcuts to unicode in shortcutFromSetting (a.k.a strokeFromSetting)

- Removed g.safeStringCompare.  This function was a bad idea.

Important: Leo is supposed to convert all characters to unicode, so there should
never be a need for safeStringCompare. The proper way to avoid UnicodeError's is
to call g.toUnicode(s,g.app.tkEncoding).</t>

I'm trying to set up a default stylesheet for a project and want this to be
held relative to the project directory (where the .leo file is). The default
is to place it in the same directory as the output, which is a couple of levels
down.

http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3639216

g.os_path_dirname(self.outputFileName) with self.c.frame.openDirectory. This
makes the path relative to the project. Not 100% as the stylesheet filename
would need a path embedded in it to move the location down the tree. However,
it is consistent with the way the output file is named.</t>

This version fixes a long-standing MacOS bug.  It is likely to be the last
beta release before 4.4 final.  This release also adds several new commands
and contains a script for updating leoSettings.leo.

Warning: The previous beta was not widely distributed. Please do some testing in
your environment before recommending this version of Leo to others, (such as
your students).

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.4:
--------------------------
- An Emacs-like mini-buffer: you can now execute any command by typing its long
name, with tab completion.

- Many new commands, including cursor and screen movement, basic character, word
and paragraph manipulation, and commands to manipulate buffers, the kill ring,
regions and rectangles. You can use Leo without using a mouse.

- Flexible key bindings and input modes. You can emulate the operation of Emacs,
Vim, or any other editor.

- A tabbed log pane. The Find and Spell Check commands now use tabs instead of
dialogs, making those commands much easier to use. Plugins or scripts can easily
create new tabs. The Completion tab shows possible typing completions.

- Autocompletion and calltips.  Autocompletion works much like tab completion.

- Dozens of other new features and bug fixes since Leo 4.3.3.

<t tx="ekr.20060417092825.1">See the (presently disabled) script button in scripts.leo at:

Buttons--&gt;@@button updateSettings

From the docstring:

Here is a **preliminary** script that updates a new leoSettings.leo file
(path2) from the settings in a previous leoSettings.leo file (path1).
Presumably, the path2 file is the leoSettings.leo file from a new distribution,
and the path1 file a leoSettings.leo file containing settings that you have
modified.  You must specify the full path of both files in the top-level @button node.

**Warning**: This script modifies the path2 file. Make sure that you don't mind
modifying this file.

**Warning**: This script is unsophisticated in its update algorithm. If if finds
corresponding nodes (node with the same settings name) in both outlines it simply
replaces the node in the path2 file with the node in the path1 file. In
particular, it does not keep track of individual shortcuts: it replaces the body
of one @shortcuts node with the body of the corresponding @shortcuts node.

**Note**: If the path1 file contains a settings node not in the path2 file it
attempts to create a new node in the corresponding place in the path2 file. If
this is not possible, say because the structures of the files are different, the
script places the new node as the last child of the @settings node in the path2
file.</t>

It seems that copying and pasting nodes with CTRL-SHIFT-C, V is not working.
- (legacy bindings)
- select a node
- CTRL-SHIFT-C
- CTRL-SHIFT-V
- Vim opens up! I expect to paste the node. The clipboard doesn't seem to contain
any XML
- The menu items show that these keys are bound to the copy and paste node
commands

*** Also on legacy bindings the arrow keys don't seem to move the cursor in the

Leo 4.4.1 beta 1 is available at:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3458&amp;package_id=29106

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.4.1:
----------------------------
- A new colorizer plugin controlled by jEdit language description files.
  At present this plugin only reliably colors @language python code.
- Multiple editors in Leo's body pane.
- Search commands now support regex replace patterns: \1, \2, etc.
- Support for external debuggers: see http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/debuggers.html
- The scripting plugin now creates a Debug Script button.
- Several new commands including run-unit-test, python-help and toggle-invisibles.
- The help-for-command commands now contains information for almost all commands.
- A new shortcut_button plugin.

&lt;&lt; Theory of operation of find/change &gt;&gt;

class leoFind:

    """The base class for Leo's Find commands."""

    @others</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060608111953.3">@ The find and change commands are tricky; there are many details that must be handled properly. This documentation describes the leo.py code. Previous versions of Leo used an inferior scheme.  The following principles govern the leoFind class:

1. Find and Change commands initialize themselves using only the state of the
   present Leo window. In particular, the Find class must not save internal
   state information from one invocation to the next. This means that when the
   user changes the nodes, or selects new text in headline or body text, those
   changes will affect the next invocation of any Find or Change command.
   Failure to follow this principle caused all kinds of problems in the Borland
   and Macintosh codes. There is one exception to this rule: we must remember
   where interactive wrapped searches start. This principle simplifies the code
   because most ivars do not persist. However, each command must ensure that the
   Leo window is left in a state suitable for restarting the incremental
   (interactive) Find and Change commands. Details of initialization are
   discussed below.

2. The Find and Change commands must not change the state of the outline or body
   pane during execution. That would cause severe flashing and slow down the
   commands a great deal. In particular, c.selectVnode and c.editPosition
   methods must not be called while looking for matches.

3. When incremental Find or Change commands succeed they must leave the Leo
   window in the proper state to execute another incremental command. We restore
   the Leo window as it was on entry whenever an incremental search fails and
   after any Find All and Change All command.

Initialization involves setting the self.c, self.p, self.in_headline, self.wrapping and self.s_ctrl ivars. Setting self.in_headline is tricky; we must be sure to retain the state of the outline pane until initialization is complete. Initializing the Find All and Change All commands is much easier because such initialization does not depend on the state of the Leo window.

Using Tk.Text widgets for both headlines and body text results in a huge simplification of the code. Indeed, the searching code does not know whether it is searching headline or body text. The search code knows only that self.s_ctrl is a Tk.Text widget that contains the text to be searched or changed and the insert and sel Tk attributes of self.search_text indicate the range of text to be searched. Searching headline and body text simultaneously is complicated. The selectNextPosition() method handles the many details involved by setting self.s_ctrl and its insert and sel attributes.

Leo 4.4.1 beta 2 is available at:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3458&amp;package_id=29106

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.4.1:
----------------------------
- A new colorizer plugin controlled by jEdit language description files.
  At present this plugin only reliably colors @language python code.
- Multiple editors in Leo's body pane.
- Search commands now support regex replace patterns: \1, \2, etc.
- Support for external debuggers: see http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/debuggers.html
- The scripting plugin now creates a Debug Script button.
- Several new commands including run-unit-test, python-help and toggle-invisibles.
- The help-for-command commands now contains information for almost all commands.
- A new shortcut_button plugin.

<t tx="ekr.20060620094645.107">Leo now supports bindings of the form:

command-name !command = shortcut

You will find examples in leoSettings.leo in the node

@keys EKR bindings: vim mode bindings--&gt;Shortcuts--&gt;@shortcuts top-level keys

Such bindings are essential for all plain key bindings that are *only* to be executed in command mode.  Most, but *not* all plain key bindings should be bound in the !command 'pane'.  The two exceptions presently are '.' which *always* invokes the autocompleter code and '(' which *always* invokes the calltips code.

It is now possible to have a *single* set of key bindings be 'Emacs-like' and
'Vim-like' at the same time. See the node EKR bindings: vim mode bindings in
leoSettings.leo.

One setting switches between emacs-like operation and vim-like operation:

For emacs, use:
@strings  [ignore,insert,overwrite] top_level_unbound_key_action = insert

For vim, use:
@strings  [ignore,insert,overwrite] top_level_unbound_key_action = ignore

Vim-like modes are made possible by two new features:

1. Entry commands in @mode nodes. In the body of @mode nodes, lines of the form

--&gt; command-name

tell Leo to execute the command when entering the mode. More than one such lines
may exist; Leo executes them in the order they appear. Entry commands are
potentially a very powerful feature. To avoid chaos, entry commands should not
alter the minibuffer :-)

2. Silent modes. In order to keep the selected text visible, Leo must *not* move
focus into the minibuffer for editing commands. The set-silent-mode command
tells Leo to treat the mode described in the @mode node as a silent mode. A true
mode is created, but it only affects key bindings and the minibuffer never
becomes active.

Thus, all @mode nodes for vim-like modes contain the following line:

--&gt; set-silent-mode.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060620094645.108">All sets of key bindings in leoSettings.leo now start with @keys in the headline
of the root node. The @keys convention is used *only* by the Check Bindings
script. So now, instead of having a static list of key bindings sets (which is
guaranteed to get out-of-date), the Check Bindings script can scan all of
leoSettings.leo for sets of key bindings.

Another improvement to the Check Bindings script. Besides doing a better job of
checking, you may now specify optional commands, such as commands defined in
plugins. The Check Bindings will not complain if the commands don't presently
exists in k.commandsDict. You specify such commands by adding items to the
following lists in the root node of the Check Bindings script, i.e., the node
Buttons--&gt;@button Check Bindings.

optionalCommandPrefixes = ['group-operations']
optionalCommandNames = []</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060620094645.109">- added isearch-with-present-options.
- many small improvements to isearch code.
- regex searches now highlighted properly.
- isearches are (and should be) confined to a single body text.
- Backspace now handled properly.

A small glitch. Starting a regexp pattern with '.' will cause the entire pattern
to turn red initially, which is technically correct but perhaps a bit
confusing.</t>

The scripting plugin now creates a press-x-button command for each scripting button named x.
You can bind shortcuts to such commands by placing @shortcuts nodes in an @setting tree in the outline containing the @button nodes.  test.leo shows an example.

What I did:
    
- The scripting plugin now defines button bindings with the 'button' pane specifier.
  This takes precedence over all other specifiers.

- k.bindKeyToDict now does a better job of detecting and warning about redefinitions.

- k.printBindings now properly sorts entries.
  This was causing me a great deal of confusion.

- k.registerCommand now properly gets shortcuts from settings if possible,
  and makes bindings in the new 'button' pane specifier.

- masterKeyHandlerHelper now supports the 'button' pane specifier,
  which overrides all others.

In Doc_Only_Mode the rst3 plugin outputs headlines irrespective of the show_headlines
setting.  The other modes do honor this setting.

I scratched around and managed to fix this by changing the node: rst3.py--&gt;class
rstClass--&gt;write methods--&gt;writeBody &amp; helpers--&gt;handleDocOnlyMode

In Line 25 I added a new statement:
     if showHeadlines:
and indented the following 3 lines to make them conditional on this if:
        if result or showThisHeadline or showOrganizers or p == self.topNode:
            # g.trace(len(result),p.headString())

I am looking at the image plugin for organizing photos, and discovered that
it is limited to gif files only.  I found this a bit silly as installing the
ImageTk module from the Python Imaging Library and making a two line change
to the plugin enables it to be used on practically any image type.

The two line are:
1.  a new import:-
import ImageTk

2. In &lt;&lt;select image&gt;&gt; line 9 change 
photo = Tk.PhotoImage(master=a.root, file=filename)

to

photo = ImageTk.PhotoImage(master=a.root, file=filename)</t>

OK, I found out how to duplicate this one.  This caused me a lot of grief until
I found out what is causing it.

NodeA:
...Child1
...Child2
...Child3

NodeB:
...CloneChild1
...CloneChild2
...CloneChild3

Now, put cursor on NodaA.  Ctrl-Shift-C (copy node).
Next, put cursor on CloneChild3.  Paste Node as Clone
You should get an invalid paste clone message.

Now, first cursor move (for me) puts NodeB as top node, ERASING all other nodes.
Warning:  DO NOT SAVE NOW.  It will erase all other nodes.

I have a tree of some 2500 nodes, run a script that marks
probably 1500-2000 of them, and that's quick (2-3 seconds max.).

I can clear all the marks with:

for p in c.allNodes_iter():
    p.v.clearMarked()

and that also is quick (2-3 seconds max.).  But when I use the menu option Unmark
All, that takes forever (1-2 minutes :-) running 100% CPU all the while.</t>

The highlights of Leo 4.4.2:
----------------------------
- You can now store settings in myLeoSettings.leo without fear of those settings
  being changed by cvs updates or in future versions of Leo.
- Leo's vnode and tnode classes are now completely independent of the rest of Leo.
  Some api's have been changed.  This 'big reorg' and may affect scripts and plugins.
- Leo's vnode and tnode classes can optionally be compatible with ZODB databases,
  i.e., they can optionally derive from ZODB.Persistence.Persistent.
  See Chapter 17: Using ZODB with Leo for details.
- The leoOPML plugin defines commands to read and write OPML files.
- The slideshow plugin allows Leo to run slideshows defined by @slideshow and @slide nodes.
- The leo_to_rtf and leo_to_html plugins create rtf and html files from Leo outlines.
- Much faster navigation through the outline using Alt-arrow keys.
- When focus is in the outline pane, you can move to headlines by typing the first letter of headlines.
- The find command now closes nodes not needed to show the node containing the present match.
- Numerous changes that make Leo easier to use without using a mouse.
- Many new minibuffer commands now appear in the Cmds menu.

<t tx="ekr.20060928172525.81">What I did:
    
- Removed c argument from t, v and p ctors.
- Removed c argument from most position methods.
    - In particular, p.link, p.unlink, v.link and v.unlink no longer update c.currentPosition()
    - Moved all position methods that still had a c argument to the Commands class.
- Removed p.allNodes_iter.
- Added c.findRootPosition and c.findRootVnode.
- c.rootPosition now returns c.findRootPosition(c.currentPosition())

As a result:
    
- The tnode, vnode and position classes are *completely* independent of Leo.
  In particular, no tnode, vnode or position method gets a c argument.
- The p.link, p.unlink, v.link and v.unlink are significantly simpler.
- The machinery for keeping the root position up-to-date is
  simple and confined to one place in the Commands class.</t>

My present thinking is that scripts should be able to store/retrieve persistent
objects to/from the zodb. That is, the zodb plugin is likely to be retired.

Leo's vnode and tnode classes now derive from ZODB.Persistence.Persistent if
leoNodes.use_zodb is True. It remains to be seen whether having use_zodb = True
will cause any serious problems.

See the posting below (Scripting using zodb) for latest details.

See the node 'zodb get/put buttons' in test.leo for examples of how scripts can access zodb easily.

Created g.init_zodb and v.detach.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060928172525.197">&gt; Do you see zodb as persisting Leo files or Leo nodes?

Interesting question.  I now see the zodb plugin as a proof-of-concept for *user-defined* scripts.  The zodb plugin is probably going to go away.

Let us suppose that db is a ZODB.DB instance. (To see how to create such an instance, see the init_zodb method in the zodb plugin.  Perhaps I'll defines something like g.openZodb to make this easier.)  Then the statements:

connection = db.open()
root = connection.root()
root[aKey] = v
get_transaction().commit()
connection.close()

will write all of v's data (all vnodes and tnodes) to the zodb.  This is true whatever v is: it can be the root of an entire outline, or any suboutline.  If you want to write a single node, you would have to 'detach' that node from the outline.  You can do this by copying the node and then unlinking the node from its descendants. Perhaps I could add a convenience method to the vnode class to make this easier.

&gt;Do you see zodb work as providing enhanced access to nodes across multiple files?

Scripts could do so easily.  Happily, the distinction between 'long-lived' and 'short-lived' connections is not important for scripts: a script should hold a connection open only for as long as needed.  So it would be easy to write any number of vnode trees to the zodb.  Later, another script could access any of the data in the zodb by zodb key.  Like this:

connection = db.open()
root = connection.root()
v = root.get(aKey)
p = leoNodes.position(v,[])

After running this script, p is a position representing the root of the tree of 'imported' vnodes.  The script above does not 'connect' the imported trees to an outline, nor should it do so.  As I write this, I realize that the position ctor should make the second argument optional, so that leoNodes.position(v) would be equivalent to leoNodes.position(v,[]).

Each script should open at most connection at a time and be sure to close any zodb connection it creates.  The proper way to do this is in a finally statement, like this:

try:
....connection = db.open()
....root = connection.root()
....v = root.get(aKey)
....p = leoNodes.position(v,[])
....&lt;&lt; do something with the nodes in p's tree&gt;&gt;
finally:
....get_transaction().commit()
....connection.close()

In short, the recent changes to Leo's vnode and tnode classes give scripts the ability to save/retrieve Leo data to/from the zodb in any way a script wants, without any further support from Leo, or from me.

I shall spend an hour or two more with the zodb plugin, but it looks to me that the plugin has served its purpose.  Rather than trying to guess how people will want to use the zodb, it will be simpler and more general to have people write scripts that do exactly what they want.  In particular, such scripts can easily sidestep the problems with multiple open connections.

Edward

P.S. Please note that the scripts shown above could not have been written without all the recent work with the zodb plugin and the big code reorg.

P.P.S. A couple of unit tests involving the new v/t.__hash__ methods just failed, so it may be just a little bit longer before the code on cvs is truly zodb ready.  I'll also be working on example scripts and the convenience methods described above.

Leo 4.4.2 beta 2 is available at:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3458&amp;package_id=29106

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.4.2:
----------------------------
- You can now store settings in myLeoSettings.leo without fear of those settings
  being changed by cvs updates or in future versions of Leo.
- Leo's vnode and tnode classes are now completely independent of the rest of Leo.
  Some api's have been changed.  This 'big reorg' and may affect scripts and plugins.
- Leo's vnode and tnode classes can optionally be compatible with ZODB databases,
  i.e., they can optionally derive from ZODB.Persistence.Persistent.
  See Chapter 17: Using ZODB with Leo for details.
- The leoOPML plugin defines commands to read and write OPML files.
- The slideshow plugin allows Leo to run slideshows defined by @slideshow and @slide nodes.
- The leo_to_rtf and leo_to_html plugins create rtf and html files from Leo outlines.
- Much faster navigation through the outline.
- When focus is in the outline pane, you can move to headlines by typing the first letter of headlines.
- The find command now optionally closes nodes not needed to show the node containing the present match.
- Numerous changes that make Leo easier to use without using a mouse, including new commands and options.
- Many new minibuffer commands now appear in the Cmds menu.
- A sax parser can now optionally read .leo files.
- Fixed numerous bugs.

Leo's theory of relativity

1. We can archive any position p by saving the list [p.childIndex() for p in
   p.self_and_parents_iter()]. Let us call the *reverse* of this list the
   **parents index list**. Clearly, this list provides an unambiguous way of
   reaching position p from the root node. Archived positions, like all other
   positions, become invalid when the outline changes. 
 
2. Leo's position class can be based on parents index lists. Let us call such
   positions **new positions**. Replacing legacy positions with new position
   will have important benefits: 
 
- The only structure information in vnodes will be a v.links field. Two
  interpretations of v.links are possible. When Leo's data is a DAG (the clone
  world), v.links is a lists of v's children. This is the legacy world we all
  know and love. When Leo's data is an arbitrary graph, v.links is simply the
  list of all vnodes to which v points, with *no* necessary restrictions on what
  nodes may be contained in v.links. 
 
- New positions provide a self contained way of traversing an arbitrary graphs
  **largely independently** of the data. This is Leo's theory of relativity. The
  notions of 'parent' and 'sibling' have meaning *only* in the context of a
  particular position. The v.links field appears to be the absolute minimum
  amount of structure information that vnodes must contain. v.links defines the
  children or linked-to nodes in a general graph. 
 
- Leo's data can be considered an unrooted tree: *any* node could be considered
  the root. New positions provide enough information to traverse an arbitrary
  graph starting at any node. 
 
- The fundamental p.moveToX methods should be significantly faster. All of Leo's
  iterators use p.moveToX methods. 
 
3. The changeover to new positions can be done easily. Initially, the api of the
   new position class will be identical to the api of the present position
   class. Later, the api for the new position class might be extended in an
   upward compatible manner. The api's for the vnode and tnode class will remain
   strictly unchanged. 
 
4. These changes imply no change to the separation of data into vnodes and
   tnodes. This separation is required to handle clones. Furthermore, the format
   of .leo files is a separate issue from the internal representation of Leo's
   data, as proved by the opml plugin. Thus, the transition to new positions
   will have *no* effect on file formats, and no effect of scripts. All scripts
   will continue to work *exactly* as they have before, *except* scripts, e.g.
   unit tests, that probe Leo's internals. 
 
Summary 
 
Leo's theory of relativity is this: the position class provides a 'frame of
reference' for traversing data. **Only in a particular frame of reference** do
the notions of 'parent' and 'siblings' have meaning. Leo's theory of relatively
is the ultimate expression of LeoUser's notion of a 'sea of nodes'. It provides
a solid context on which to base traversals of either outlines with clones
(DAG's) or general directed graphs. 
 
Leo's position class, far from being just a technical tool, is important
theoretically. The position class (old or new) provides the essential tool
needed to separate data from traversals of the data. The re-visioning of the
position and vnode classes brings that potential into reality.

This was a major effort.  What I did:
    
- Defined g.isWordChar in terms of ch.isalnum()

- Replace almost all instances of string.letters and string.digits by calls to
  ch.isalnum(), ch.isalpha(), ch.isdigit(), etc.
  
- Similarly, replaced word_chars.

- The new code uses string literals only for

a) small constants like '+-' and
b) constants in a very limited context, as in the input to regexp.</t>

auto-complete-force         = None # This command needs work before it is useful. Ctrl-period
show-calltips-force         = None # This command needs work before it is useful. Alt-parenleft

The problem is that autocompletion depends on state: self.leadinWord,
prevObjects, etc. Thus, it's not presently possible to start the process
anywhere. Similar remarks apply to calltips, which relies on autocompleter
state.

This is a complex problem, and not very serious now that there is an easy way of
toggling autocompleter and calltips on and off. It's been added to a 'later'

<t tx="ekr.20070122070634.223">New settings

The following two new settings now control whether the execute-script and debug commands write the script to an external file.

- @bool write_script_file = True

True: The execute script command writes the script to be executed to a file, then executes the script using Python's execFile function. The script_file_path setting specifies the path to this file.
    
False (legacy): The execute script command uses Python's exec command to execute the script. 

- @string script_file_path = ../test/scriptFile.py

The path to the file to be written by the execute-script command.

Notes:
    
- This setting has effect only if the write_script_file setting is True.
- Use / to as the path delimiter, regardless of platform.
- The default path is ../test/scriptFile.py if no path is given.
- The path starts at g.app.loadDir, so for example ../test/scriptFile.py is equivalent to leo/test/scriptFile.py
- The filename should end in .py.

From here on, let us assume the settings are as shown above.  There are at least three ways of debugging scripts, depending on your preferences and whether the script contains leo-specific code (g, c or p) or not.

First way:  The debug command

The debug command now works almost exactly like Kent's original @button node. This way of debugging can only be used for general scripts, not leo-specific scripts.  

The debug command writes the script to scriptFile.py and invokes the debugger as specified by the existing @string debugger_kind option.  winpdb opens and is already 'attached' to the script to be debugged.  You can single-step as you like.  Leo continues to run, but killing the debugger will also kill Leo.  When started this way, winpdb is really 'attached' to *all* of Leo, which means you can single step past the end of the script into Leo's executeScript code and from there into all of Leo(!)

As I write this I realize that the code uses arguments specific to winpdb.  That may have to be generalized, though I am not sure why anyone would want to use another debugger...

Second way: @button winpdb

This is almost exactly equivalent to the debug command, except that the script file must be *different* from the script file specified by the  script_file_path setting (The @button code *itself* uses the execute-script command, so we have to pass the script code, not the @button code to the debugger).

Third way: The execute-script command with explicit debugger breaks

The third way of debugging scripts allows winpdb to debug scripts that use c, g and p.  I'm actually not sure of exactly how and why it works, but it certainly does work.

In contrast to the previous two ways, a little more work is needed because winpdb does not start automatically.  But I am getting ahead of myself.

To use this way, insert the following two lines of code at the start of the script to be debugged::

import rpdb2
rpdb2.start_embedded_debugger('go',fAllowUnencrypted=True)

Now just execute the execute-script command (*not* the debug command)  Leo will appear to hang.  Indeed, the  start_embedded_debugger command is waiting for *another* copy of winpdb to 'attach' to the script's process.  This process is all of Leo!  The default timeout is 5 minutes: I'm not sure what happens when the timeout happens: probably an exception gets thrown.

So you must start winpdb explicitly.  On XP just do something like

python c:\python25\Scripts\_winpdb.py -t

The -t option tells winpdb that no encoding of password is necessary.  The password is specified in the call to rpdb2.start_embedded_debugger in your script.  In this example, the password is 'go'.  Use the File:Attach command in winpdb to attach winpdb to Leo.  Specify the password as 'go' and you will see the scriptFile.py containing your entire script.  You can execute or single-step through the script. 

To repeat, the big difference is that c, g and p are defined, so you can debug any script this way.  As before, killing winpdb also kills Leo.

P.S.  winpdb and its documentation has been improved recently.  See

http://www.digitalpeers.com/pythondebugger/  and especially

http://www.digitalpeers.com/pythondebugger/embedded.htm

The discussion of embedded debugging may have been written specifically with Leo in mind.  It certainly could have been.

When a node is among several other nodes at the same level of hierarchy, which
are all children of a node, and the "MOVE LEFT" command is executed, the node
does move left in the outline hierarchy, but it also move down to just before
the next node at the higher hierarchy level - the level to which it is moving
left.

This option tells how to treat an uppercase letter typed when the outline pane

node whose headline starts with the present prefix, ignoring case The prefix
starts with the first letter typed and other letters are added if they are typed
within a 'short' period of time, as specified by the outline_nav_extend_delay

True: Look in invisible nodes.
False: Look only in visible nodes.

- Added support for @enabled-plugins nodes in settings files.
- The__wx_gui plugin is now functional.
- Removed all gui-dependent code from Leo's core.
- Better support for the winpdb debugger.
- Many minor improvements, new settings and bug fixes.

I'm generating Leo files with ElementTree and ran into a minor issue.

ElementTree generates an empty tag with a space before the closing slash:
    
&lt;globals /&gt;

in Leo's code for dummy elements to allow copied nodes to be valid Leo files,
the empty tags are generated without the space

leoFileCommands.py 2917
        self.put('&lt;globals/&gt;\n')
        self.put('&lt;preferences/&gt;\n')
        self.put('&lt;find_panel_settings/&gt;\n')
        
it then checks for these tags in getDummyElements() leoFileCommands.py 1298

Since ElementTree has the space before the slash, 
it's XML is considered invalid by Leo according to
this test.

I would like it if the space could be added in Leo's
self.put(...) and the check in getDummyElements()

The XML specs show the space as optional.

<t tx="ekr.20070316182341.440">The leoBridge module allows complete access to all aspects of Leo from programs
running independently of Leo. Let us call such a program a **host** program.
Using the leoBridge module, foreign programs can get access to:
    
- all of Leo's source code,
- the contents of any .leo file,
- the commander of any .leo file.

Host programs use the leoBridge module as follows::

    import leoBridge
    controller = leoBridge.controller(gui='nullGui')
    g = controller.globals()
    c = controller.openLeoFile(path)
    
Let us look at these statements in detail.  The statements::
    
    import leoBridge
    controller = leoBridge.controller(gui='nullGui')
    
import the leoBridge module and create a **bridge controller**. In effect, these
statements embed an 'invisible' copy Leo into the host program. This embedded
copy of Leo uses a 'null' gui, which simulates all aspects of Leo's normal gui
code without creating any screen objects.

The statement::

    g = controller.globals()
    
provides access to Leo's leoGlobals module, and properly inits globals such as g.app, g.app.gui, etc.  Host programs **should not** import leoGlobals directly, because doing so would not init the g.app object properly.

The statement::

    c = controller.openLeoFile(path)
    
invisibly opens the .leo file given by the ``path``argument. This call returns a
completely standard Leo commander, properly inited. This is the big payoff from
the leoBridge module: the host program gets instant access to c.config.getBool,
etc. Do you see how sweet this is?

The following script runs leo/test/leoBridgeTest.py outside of Leo.
leoBridgeTest.py uses the leoBridge module to run all unit tests in leo/test/unitTest.leo.
Try it::
    
    import os,sys

    path = g.os_path_abspath(
        g.os_path_join(
            g.app.loadDir,'..','test','leoBridgeTest.py'))

@settings node.

Notes:

A) Leo attempts to load all plugins every time an @enabled-plugins node is seen.
   If the plugin has already been loaded, Leo silently ignores the
   request to re-enable the plugin.
   Leo never attempts to disable a plugin while processing enabled plugin
   strings. Thus, plugins enabled in an @enabled-plugins node in leoSettings.leo
   *will* be enabled regardless of the contents of any other @enabled-plugins node.

B) The default plugins will be enabled in an @enabled-plugins
   node in leoSettings.leo.

<t tx="ekr.20070513111526.42">Leo now supports zipped .leo files:

- Leo now has save-file-as-zipped and save-file-as-unzipped commands, and
corresponding Save File As Zipped and Save File as Unzipped items in the File
menu. These are exactly the same as Leo's Save As commands except that they
temporarily force Leo to write the file in either zipped or unzipped format.

- Leo remembers whether a file was originally zipped. The read logic handles
either zipped or unzipped .leo files automatically. The write logic will zip the
file if it was originally zipped or if the save-file-as-zipped command is being
executed.

- Leo writes files with .leo extension, regardless of whether the file is zipped
or not. Zipped .leo files contain a single archive, whose name is the same as
the .leo file itself.

Notes:

- The new save commands suffice to compress and expand .leo files on a
file-by-file basis. In particular, there is no need for any user settings.

- Outside of Leo you can change the extension to .leo.zip and use stuffit or
other program to expand the .leo file contained within. I've only tested this on
XP, but it should work everywhere...

- At present the code uses Python's zipfile module to read and write zipped files.
In turn, the zipfile module uses the zlib module to do the compression.
Conceivably somebody might want Leo to use some other compression technique, say
Python's tarfile module. However, I think the present way should suffice for
most people.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20070513112414">- Added support for chapters to Leo's core

  Chapters are regions of a Leo outline whose root is an @chapter node. @chapter
  nodes may appear anywhere in an outline, but the create-chapter command (see
  below) creates @chapter nodes as children of a single @chapters node.
  
  Selecting a chapter shows only then nodes in the selected chapter; in this
  respect, chapters are like hoists. The main chapter represents the entire
  outline and can not be deleted by name. When chapters are in effect, Leo
  creates a hidden @chapters node containing one @chapter node for every chapter
  except the 'main' chapter.
  
  Associated settings:
      
  - The @bool use_chapters setting determines whether chapters are enabled.
  - The @bool use_chapter_tabs setting determines whether the chapters
    pop-up menu appears in the icon area. Choosing a chapter name from this list selects a chapter.

  When chapters are enabled, the Cmds:Chapters menu shows all available chapter commands:
      
  - The create-chapter command creates an @chapter node and with a single node.
  - The delete-chapter command deletes the presently selected chapter.
  - The select-chapter command makes only the nodes of the selected chapter visible.
  - The move-node-to-chapter, clone-node-to-chapter and copy-node-to-chapter commands
    add a node (and its descendants) to another chapter.</t>

- The node is selected, but shift-arrow does not work.

However, clicking the canvas does work.

The fix was to give the canvas, not the headline focus when clicking on a headline.
This results in canvas bindings, not text bindings, having priority.
This is not a kludge: the text widget isn't active, so text bindings should not be in effect.

<t tx="ekr.20070622180342">- Added support for chapters to Leo's core

  Chapters are regions of a Leo outline whose root is an @chapter node. @chapter
  nodes may appear anywhere in an outline, but the create-chapter command (see
  below) creates @chapter nodes as children of a single @chapters node.
  
  Selecting a chapter shows only then nodes in the selected chapter; in this
  respect, chapters are like hoists. The main chapter represents the entire
  outline and can not be deleted by name. When chapters are in effect, Leo
  creates a hidden @chapters node containing one @chapter node for every chapter
  except the 'main' chapter.
  
  Associated settings:
      
  - The @bool use_chapters setting determines whether chapters are enabled.
  - The @bool use_chapter_tabs setting determines whether the chapters
    pop-up menu appears in the icon area. Choosing a chapter name from this list selects a chapter.

  When chapters are enabled, the Cmds:Chapters menu shows all available chapter commands:
      
  - The create-chapter command creates an @chapter node and with a single node.
  - The delete-chapter command deletes the presently selected chapter.
  - The select-chapter command makes only the nodes of the selected chapter visible.
  - The move-node-to-chapter, clone-node-to-chapter and copy-node-to-chapter commands
    add a node (and its descendants) to another chapter.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20070701090840">Leo is not your ordinary text editor, class browser, project manager or database manager,
though it resembles these programs in some respects.
Understanding what Leo is does take some work:
many people have reported an 'Aha!' experience when they first understand what Leo is all about.

Leo is built on simple foundations:
    
- Leo is an outliner. All Leo data resides in an `outline`_. Outlines can
  contain text, computer programs, web sites, pictures, or any other kind of
  data. Leo can show such information, including pictures and movies, directly
  in the outline.
  
- Using `cloned nodes`_, you can put the same information (outline node) in
  multiple places. You don't have to decide, once and for all, where the 'right'
  place to put data: you can 'file' information in as many places as you like.
  But Leo is more than just the ultimate filing cabinet. Using clones, an
  outline can, in effect, show multiple views of the data *in that outline*.
  Again, you do not have to decide, once and for all, which is the 'right' view.
  You can have as many views as you like. For example, suppose you have an
  outline that contains all of your slides (or links to them.) Using clones, any
  of your slides could appear in as many slideshows as you like.

These features allow you to organize personal information such as web links or
pictures. Other features make Leo a powerful environment for programming and web
development:
    
- Unlike most file and class browsers, Leo has a memory. Leo allows you complete
  freedom to organizer and reorganize your outline as you like. Leo remembers
  the organization and expansion state of your outline when you save it, and
  restores the outline and expansion state when you reload the outline.
    
- Leo is a virtual file system and data manager. Leo can generate files based on
  data contained in outline. Such `derived files`_ can contain anything that the
  outline contains: text, computer programs, pictures, etc.
  
- You can use outlines to organize your programs, data and scripts. Using a
  markup language based on noweb_, you can easily tell Leo how to assemble
  programs and scripts from text in a portion of an outline.
  
- Leo's import commands convert already-existing programs into Leo pre-organized
  outlines, much like class browsers do. Unlike class browsers, you are then
  free to reorganize the outline so that it is easy to understand. This is a
  great way to study other people's programs.
  
- The structure of Leo outlines is directly accessible to Python scripts.
  Scripts can directly access all nodes (headlines and body text) of an outline.
  There is no need to 'parse' data into constituent parts. Furthermore scripts
  can easily insert, delete and move nodes. For example, unit tests can create
  nodes that represent the expected result of a unit test.

- Any Leo script can easily be applied to a selected part of the outline. This
  is an incredibly powerful and flexible feature. For example, it is very easy
  to create 'text editing' scripts that automate tedious, repetitive programming
  tasks.
  
- It is easy to write `plugins`_ to alter any aspect of Leo's operation. Dozens
  of plugins already exist.
  
- Nodes naturally represent both data (body text) and its description or
  meta-data (headline). By convention, many plugins and commands look for
  headlines of the form @x. Examples include @test and @suite for unit tests,
  @url for web links, @slideshow and @slide for groups of slides, @auto for
  automatically imported files, @folder for nodes created automatically from a
  folder on the computer's file system, and many others.
  Two kinds of meta-data deserve special mention. Unit tests can easily define
  their own meta-data, such as 'before' and 'after'. These data describe the
  initial conditions of the unit tests and the expected result.
  The @rst plugin uses various kinds of @rst nodes to organize
  `reStructuredText`_ and to control how that text is organized. For full
  details, see `Chapter 14: Using the Rst3 Plugin`_.
  
- Leo coexists well with other editors such as Emacs and Vim. Leo has
  several plugins that allow you easily to switch between Emacs (or Vim) and
  Leo. Moreover, Leo allows you complete flexibility to use the key bindings you
  like.
  
Several people have asked me, "How can Leo help me with programming?".
Here is a short answer that summarizes the discussion so far:
    
- Leo's outlines allow you to see the organization of complex programs more
  clearly than with any other tool.
  
- Leo's allows you to organize programs and scripts more flexibly than with any
  other tool. In particular, noweb is a perfect match for outlines.
  
- Leo scripts are much more powerful than in other scripting environments
  because Leo scripts have easy access to headlines and data without having to
  parse data. **Outline structure is real data**: scripts can easily access the
  parents and descendants of any node. The practical benefits are almost
  endless.

- You can do things with Leo that are not possible with Emacs or Vim. In fact,
  you can do things with Leo that are not even *conceivable or expressible* with
  Emacs or Vim.

One last word. Leo has a strong and active community of users on `SourceForge`_.
Working with this community has been a constant source of joy and inspiration.
Suggestions and plugins from users continue to drive Leo in excellent new
directions. Who knows what the next plugin will bring? -- Edward K. Ream</t>

Leo 4.4.4 beta 1 is available at:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3458&amp;package_id=29106

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.4.4:
----------------------------

- A threading_colorizer plugin replaces the __jEdit_colorizer__ plugin.
  This plugin features much better performance.

- Support for @auto nodes.  Such nodes allow people to collaborate using Leo
  without inserting Leo sentinels in the files Leo generates.

<t tx="ekr.20070806095535.1">@auto trees allows people to use Leo in collaborative environments without using
sentinels in the files Leo generates. In contrast to @nosent, @auto trees can
change when the corresponding file changes outside of Leo.

Leo will automatically recreate (import) all @auto trees when reading a .leo
file, and will write all dirty @auto trees when saving a .leo file. There are
two exceptions to this statement:

1. Leo will never read (import) or write an @auto tree if
the root @auto tree is under the influence of an @ignore directive.

2. Saving a .leo file does not save @auto nodes if a) they haven't been changed
or b) they do not contain a **significant** amount of information. An @auto tree
contains a significant amount of information if it has  children or if the
root node contains more than 10 characters.

Leo creates @auto trees by parsing the corresponding derived file. Parsers
create descendant nodes of the @auto tree: one node for each class, method and
function in the derived file.

Parsers presently exist for C, elisp, Java, Pascal, PHP and Python. Leo
determines the language using the file's extension. If no parser exists for a
language, the entire body of an @auto tree contains a significant amount of information if it has any children or if the root node contains more than 10 non-blank lines. the derived file is copied to the body of the @auto
node.

Leo does not write the contents of @auto trees to .leo files. In this respect,
@auto trees work much like @thin trees. @auto trees whose root node is under the
scope of an @ignore directive *will* be written to the .leo, just like @thin
trees.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070806100055">All present parsers are short overrides of a powerful base parser class. Thus,
it would be simple to add support for other languages. See the node

@thin leoImport.py--&gt;Import--&gt;Scanners for createOutline

in leoPy.leo to see how easy it is to create new parsers.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070806101412">Three new commands in the File:Read/Write menu allow you to manually read and
write @auto nodes from the presently selected outline. As always, an @ignore
directive in the @auto node or its ancestors will suppress any of these
commands:

- The Read @auto Nodes (read-at-auto-nodes) command reads all @auto nodes in the
  presently selected outline. An @ignore directive will suppress this import.

- The Write @auto Nodes (write-at-auto-nodes) command writes all @auto nodes. An
  @ignore directive will suppress this import. Caution: the write will occur even
  if Leo has not previously read the @auto node.

- The Write Dirty @auto Nodes (write-dirty-at-auto-nodes) is the same as the
  write-at-auto-nodes command, except that only changed @auto trees are written.

Most users will rarely use these explicit commands, because reading and writing
.leo files handles @auto nodes well enough. However, you can use the
read-at-auto-nodes command to update @auto nodes without having to reload the
.leo file.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070809141529">Leo performs several checks to ensure that the result of importing an external
file will be equivalent to the file that writing the @auto tree would produce.

These checks can produces **errors** or **warnings**. Errors indicate a
potentially serious problem. Leo inserts an @ignore directive in the @auto tree
if any error is found. This @ignore directive prevents the @auto tree from
modifying the external file. If you @ignore directive, a later write of the
@auto tree will attempt to fix the problems that gave rise to the errors. There
are no guarantees however.

**Strict languages** are languages like Python for which leading whitespace is
especially significant. Before importing a file for a strict language, Leo
**regularizes** the leading whitespace of all lines of the original source file.
That is, Leo converts blanks to tabs or tabs to blanks depending on the value of
the @tabwidth directive in effect for the @auto node. Leo cannot guarantee to
reproduce the original source file exactly if problems are discovered while
regularizing leading whitespace.

After importing a file, Leo verifies that writing the @auto node would create
the same file as the original file. For strict languages, the comparison must be
exact, or nearly so. For non-strict languages, differences in leading whitespace
generate warnings, not errors.

File comparison mismatches can arise for several reasons:

1. Bugs in the import parsers. Please report any suspected bugs immediately.

2. Underindented lines in classes, methods or functions in strict languages. An
   **underindented line** is a line that is indented less then the starting line
   of the class, method or function in which it appears. Leo outlines can not
   represent such lines exactly: every line of node implicitly has at least the
   indentation of any unindented line of the node.

Leo will issue a warning (not an error) for underindented Python comment lines.
Such lines can not change the meaning of Python programs.</t>

A softish bug, but the use of findNodeInTree() in the UNL code can 
take you to the wrong place if more than one node in the tree has 
the same headString.  Patch below - can still go wrong if more than 
one sibling has the same name, but the UNL system doesn't have a 
solution for that.

An observation - the UNL jumping code will drop you as far down the 
path as it gets, i.e. you're moved to the last node that was one the 
path, even if the path ends before the last part of the UNL is 
reached.  This is ok, i.e. "this is as far as I could follow the 
UNL", the alternative would be to not move at all if the whole UNL 
can't be followed.

Cheers -Terry

So I changed all my indentation to multiples of four, having decided I like
the extra line space this buys over aligning with the opening (.

leo said this when it read the file:

@auto did not import the file perfectly

but never mentioned @ignore or anything.  I made a trivial change and saved
and diff could find no difference except my trivial change... which seems perfect
to me...?

<t tx="ekr.20070915101157.168">When saving a .leo file, Leo now *reads* an @auto node if

1) the derived file exists,
2) an 'insignificant' amount of data exists in the @auto tree, and
3)the @auto node has not been read previously.

This promises to fix some quite awkward use cases.

The 'perfect import' code now is a bit more relaxed, especially for 'non-strict'
languages (all languages except Python):

- Leo leaves leading whitespace alone for non-strict languages.

- Leo complains about intermixed tabs and blanks in leading whitespace only for
strict languages.

- Leo ignores leading whitespace in the perfect import tests for non-strict
languages.

These changes mean that Leo might change a derived file if such a change occurs
only in leading whitespace in a non-strict language.</t>

Leo 4.4.4 beta 2 is available at:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3458&amp;package_id=29106

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.4.4:
----------------------------

- A threading_colorizer plugin replaces the __jEdit_colorizer__ plugin.
  This plugin features much better performance.

- Support for @auto nodes.  Such nodes allow people to collaborate using Leo
  without inserting Leo sentinels in the files Leo generates.
  
- New commands for resolving cvs conflicts.

<t tx="ekr.20070920092716">The so-called resolve-cvs-conflict project has resolved itself into small,
easily understood commands.

The **read-file-into-node** command prompts for a filename, and creates an node
whose headline is @read-file-into-node &lt;filename&gt; and whose body text is the
entire contents of the file.

The **write-file-from-node** command writes the body text of the selected not to a file.
If the headline of the presently selected node starts with @read-file-into-node
the command use the filename that follows in the headline. Otherwise, the
command prompts for a filename.

When a cvs conflict occurs, the user will:

- read the file into a node using the read-file-into-node command,

- fix the conflict, as with any other editor, and

- write the file with the write-file-from-node command.

Any file can be fixed in this way, including derived files and .leo files. The
only complication is that the user must not change sentinel lines. Two new
commands check the contents of a node: The **check-derived-file** and
**check-leo-file** commands tell whether a trial read of the presently selected
node can be done successfully. The check-derived-file command assumes the body
text is a derived file; the check-leo-file command assumes the body text is an
entire .leo file.

The **compare-leo-outlines** command prompts for another (presumably similar)
.leo file that will be compared with the presently selected outline file (main
window). It then creates clones of all inserted, deleted and changed nodes.</t>

Notes:

  'create-optional-menus' hook. This creates the Plugins menu as usual.

- Nested @menu nodes contain submenus.

- The command name follows @item. If the body text of an @item node exists, this
  body text is the menu name. Otherwise, the menu name is the command name.
  However, if the command name starts with a '*', hyphens are removed from the
  menu name.

- Menu names and command names may contain a single ampersand (&amp;). If present,
  the following character is underlined in the name.

- If the command name in an @item node is just a hyphen (-), the item represents
  a menu separator.

<t tx="ekr.20071004103659">The Great Graph Aha is:

A Leo outline doesn't have to *be* an arbitrary graph in order to *represent* an arbitrary graph.

So the graph world is unnecessary because we can use Leo nodes and trees as data
to other graphing packages.** That is, Python scripts can build arbitrary graphs
using Leo's existing nodes and trees. And Python scripts can manipulate those
graphs. And Python scripts could do the reverse: manipulate the Leo outline by
traversing general graphs. So there is no need to complicate Leo's fundamental
data structures. Hurray! Instead, we build on the strengths of already existing
graphing packages.

The Great Graph Aha created the opportunity for immediate action:

1. test.leo contains the essential scripts to implement graphs in Leo files.
   These short, simple, self-contained, easily modifiable scripts make possible
   everything ever envisaged by the (now-defunct) graph world project::

    leo2graph: convert a normal Leo tree to a NetworkX graph. 
    at-graph2graph: convert an @graph tree to a NetworkX graph. 
    at-networkx2graph: convert an @networkx tree to a NetworkX graph 
    at-networkx2at-graph: create an @graph tree from an @networkx tree.

2. The graphed plugin allows users to manipulate parts of Leo outlines as if
they were general graphs. It is still early days for this exciting plugin.</t>

I like doctests, often debug with g.es()
statements, and open winpdb to examine what's
going on.

I've a small patch to the debug command
leoEditCommands.py--&gt;debugCommandsClass--&gt;debug
to simplify this.

The patch writes the following to the beginning of
the script being debugged;

class G:
def es(s,c=None):
  pass
g = G()

This makes the g.es() statements legal.

The patch also checks for doctests in the script,
and if found, converts them to regular code.

A node containing;

&gt;&gt;&gt; import inspect, sys
&gt;&gt;&gt; insp = sys.modules['inspect']
&gt;&gt;&gt; print insp.__name__
inspect
&gt;&gt;&gt; g.es(dir(insp))

can be run as a doctest;
&lt;alt x&gt; dt
(if the dtest.py plugin is active)

or sent to winpdb;
&lt;alt x&gt; debug

The patch doesn't change the handling of regular scripts.

It goes right after;
if not winpdb: return

#check for doctest examples
try:
    import doctest
    parser = doctest.DocTestParser()
    examples = parser.get_examples(script)

    # if this is doctest, extract the examples as a script
    if len(examples) &gt; 0:
        script = doctest.script_from_examples(script)

except ImportError:
    pass

# special case; debug code may include g.es("info string")

for non-cloned nodes, but can select the 'wrong' chapter for cloned nodes.

I'm using current CVS, W2k

1 open a Leo file (I'm using a batch file / console)

2 click Edit-&gt;Open   &lt;-- Having this dialog open is the problem.

3 return focus to the Leo window

4 click Help-&gt;Open leoDocs.leo

The atFile read logic only **adds** nodes, it never deletes nodes. Thus,
the 'changed2' node 'survived' the atFile read logic. The 'changed2' node became
a 'vampire' node that couldn't be killed.

The fix will require some care. The present atFile.read logic is robust because
it *doesn't* delete nodes. I suspect the solutions will be as follows:

A. The atFile.read code can not delete the subtree of @thin nodes initially,
because it doesn't know whether there will be read errors later. If there are
read errors absolutely nothing must change. This ensures that read errors never
destroy information.

B. A new post-pass will look for vampire nodes: nodes that were not actually
read from the derived file. I think (but haven't proven) that all descendants of
vampire nodes are also vampire nodes. If that is so the post-pass will simply
delete vampire nodes without worrying about whether they have descendants.

An argument I'm always having with leo has to do with its conversion of file
paths to 'absolute' forms.

In the file browser I select '/home/tbrown/misc/foo.leo'.
Leo reinterprets this as '/media/hda2/usr1/home/tbrown/misc/foo.leo'

Then I switch machines, and while
'/home/tbrown/misc/foo.leo' would still be valid,
'/media/hda2/usr1/home/tbrown/misc/foo.leo' isn't - on the other machine it
would be '/media/hdb1/home/tbrown/misc/foo.leo'.

I end up with the two entries in recent files, having to identify the right one.

If the Tk dialog is returning '/home/tbrown/misc/foo.leo', which I assume it is
because that's what it's displaying, I wish leo would use and store that.

python /home/tbrown/.gnome-desktop/Package/leo/cvs/leo/src/leo.py /home/tbrown/.tnb.leo

gives the traceback below.  Opening the file from within Leo works fine.

Bah - I just now looked at it closely enough to realize it's the evil
pickled Tk classes in cleo uAs.  So I don't know whether you want to
fix that or not, it makes sense Leo would read the file specified on
the command line before Tk is initialized - if it's just scanning for
settings maybe it could catch and ignore failed uA reads at that time?

At some point I want to take pickled Tk vars out of cleo, I was
thinking when that guy was working on the wx gui would be a good time,
too bad he got sick.

I have clones that traverse chapters.

Given the following Chapters:

&gt; Main
&gt; Big Picture
&gt; Smaller Chunk

I have in Main, my organization, with my group in it.  It's also cloned around
all the other views (really, everything starts in the Big Picture).

This is the layout of my clone:

1:  Chapter:Main &gt; me
2:  Chapter:Main &gt; MyOrg &gt; me
3:  Chapter:Big Picture &gt; CEO &gt; Some Big Honcho &gt; MyOrg &gt; me
4:  Chapter:Smaller Chunk &gt; Some Big Honcho &gt; MyOrg &gt; me

If I Go-To-Next-Clone  (ALT-N) from (1), focus will move to the selected node
in Chapter:Main, namely (2).

So here's the issue: 

Let each successive line below represent a starting focus, and the next line
the node that ALT-N selects.  If focus changes in the Outline pane (including
Chapter pane change) to match the Node, that case is marked with [f] - a successful
focus transition.

The issue are the lines w/o [f];  Here's a couple of test runs.

1: [f] (starting node / focus)
2: [f]
3:
4:
1: [f]

Next test:

3: [f]
1: [f]
1: [f]
4:
3:
1: [f]

Next test:

4: [f]
3:
1: [f]
2: [f]
4:
3:
1: [f]
2: [f]
... and so on...

In cases with NO [f], the outline pane seems moved to the "end", but no node
selected.

Not a show stopper, but a bug nonetheless.

It seems in derived files you can delete some text and save, causing the derived

come back, as expected, but save only saves the outline, because the dirty flag

<t tx="ekr.20071217092203.138">The patch attached against leoConfig.py (current CVS) adds a machine
specific config file to the config files Leo loads.

I synchronize files between multiple (3) machines. This means I can't
use different myLeoSettings files on each.

Tk fonts are screen dpi sensitive.  But (in Linux at least)
Tk's attempts to switch a font you picked to something equivalent at a
different dpi always result in a font that looks terrible.

So every time I switch machines I edit ~/myLeoSettings.leo to move the
font defs I picked for the current machine to the bottom of the body
text for the appropriate settings node, and then restart Leo.

This patch means I don't have to do that any more.  I'm sure there are
other uses for it.  Python doesn't seem to have a generic machine name
finding function, hence the sequence of alternatives.</t>

- There was a horrendous bug in the match_seq_regexp matcher which could cause the colorizer to loop.
- There was another horrendous bug in match_regexp_helper that cause spurious matches.
- Added some more defensive code to have the colorizer recover more gracefully in this case. 
- The jedit2py script was not associating regexp rules whose regex starts with
  '\' with the proper character. The proper character is the hash_char
  character, not the '\' character. As a result, regexp's that start with '\'
  never got matched.

The following colorizers are affected by the change:

Eureka! I have just discovered an elegant solution to this problem!

The Aha is this:  we can create a "base" timestamp just *once*, when
the commander (i.e. the nodeIndices class) is created.  Thereafter,
code that writes gnx's simply calls nodeIndices.getIndex if the node
doesn't already have an index (or if indices are being reassigned in a
copied tree).

In other words, there is no need to be picky about timestamps, the
base timestamp will do, so there is no need to assign indices before
writing nodes!

I didn't see this before because computing timestamps is quite time
consuming.  In fact, we can't do so "on the fly".  That being so, the
old code computed the "new" timestamp once in assignFileIndices, which
lead me away from getting gnx's as needed.  But if there is only *one*
timestamp everything becomes easy.  There is no need to "batch" the
computation of gnx's.  In other words, timestamps don't have to be up-
to-the-second accurate.  They simply guarantee that two nodes (in a
particular outline) created by the *same* person can't collide.

This is the way it is written in "The Book". All calls to
assignFileIndices disappear!  All the code I wrote this morning that
remembers whether indices have been assigned disappears.  I'll keep a
do-nothing assignFileIndices around for compatibility with old
scripts.

This is *so* important.  It eliminates forever a source of serious
file write problems.  Furthermore, nodeIndices.getIndex becomes
substantially simpler. Even though the code was short, it implied some
very tricky assumptions.  Every time I read it I had to recreate why
it worked.  Those mental gymnastics should disappear.

A great day for Leo.

When you have two editors open on the same node most actions show up in both
editors, however, if you do an undo the change only show up in the selected
editor. (The change shows up in the other editor when you select it).

And, while you're looking at the editor code :-) - in linux when you paste in
text to a body editor with a middle mouse button click, it's not stored unless
you follow that with a key stroke or some other action in the body editor. If
you instead middle button paste to the editor and then click on another node in

If you want more details, you can do what I did: do a clone-find-all for homeDir.

As for how the home directory is set, the code to do this is g.computeHomeDir.  We get the home directory with

<t tx="ekr.20080624093059.37">Leo suppresses marks, expansion state, orphan bits and current
position bits when writing fixed .leo files.  As a result, all nodes
will be collapsed and the root node will always be selected when Leo
opens a fixed .leo file.

When writing fixed .leo files, Leo writes fixed, immutable, reasonable
defaults for window size, position and body-outline ratio.
Specifically, width,height,left,top = 700,500,50,50 and the ratio is
0.5. These values are written so older versions of Leo can read fixed
files.

You make a file fixed by putting '@bool fixedWindow = True' in the
@settings tree of a particular .leo file.  The file will be fixed
after you save the file, reload the file, and save the file again.
Yes, this is clumsy, but it only has to be done once.  A toggle-fixed
file command doesn't seem that useful: using an @bool node is simple
and clear.

You can optionally specify the size and position on the screen of
fixed .leo files by putting an '@data fixedWindowPosition' node in the
@settings tree of myLeoSettings.leo or leoSettings.leo.  You should
**not** put such a node in the fixed .leo file itself--everyone who
opens the file would get that fixed position.

The body of the '@data fixedWindowPosition' node should contain
something like this:

# Must be four entries: width,height,left,top.
# Put this in myLeoSettings.leo, **not** in individual .leo files.

1200
800
50
50

Leo uses reasonable defaults for fixed .leo files if this node does
not exist, or contains something other than 4 numbers, one per line. </t>

<t tx="ekr.20080624093059.49">Leo Configuration:
    | The following configuration was used for all testing:
        @strings  top_level_unbound_key_action = command
        @bool stayInTreeAfterEditHeadline = True
        @bool stayInTreeAfterSelect = True
        @bool outline_pane_has_initial_focus = True

Leo's Panes:
    | A "pane" is a area of the screen containing a user interface
    | dedicated to supporting a common set of tasks.  Vi key mappings are
    | associated with the Outline pane, the Body pane, or to the Leo
    | program.  See the no pane (see "General Commands" below). (Outline
    | pane, Body pane)

Leo's Command/Insert States:
    Command state - Denoted by a blue background color (Outline,Body pane)
        | Keys are mapped to commands.
    Insert state - Denoted by a red background color (Outline,Body pane)
        | Keys pressed are inserted into the text.
    Grayed state - Denoted by a gray background color (Outline pane)
        | Keys pressed will cause the next node with a headline starting
        | with that key to be selected.  This "select node by first
        | character" feature is built into Leo. It is not part of the vi
        | support.
        | 
        | This state is intentionally avoided in the vi based outline key
        | mappings. If in the "Grayed" state, enter Ctrl-i to switch to the
        | "Command" state.  The "Grayed" state can be entered from the
        | outline's "Command" state by pressing the Ctrl-] key.

Leo's modes:
| Most vi commands are implemented using Leo's "mode" functionality.
| Modes beginning with "vi-" denote a vi command for the body pane.
| Modes beginning with "tree-" denote a vi-like command for the outline.
| Modes beginning with "body-" denote outline commands that can be called
| from the body pane (and return focus back to the body pane)
| 
| Modes are used both for managing multi-key vi commands and for defining
| macros.
    
    Multi-key command modes:
    | Vi has many commands that require multiple keys to invoke.  Each key
    | accept the last in the command are assigned to a mode that, when
    | executed, maps the subsequent allowed keys in the command sequence.
    | The last key in the sequence is mapped directly to a Leo command or
    | to a "Macro" mode (see below). Any modes mapped to a key by another
    | mode are located in a child node of the mode node doing the mapping.
    | 
    | Example:
    |     dtw = Delete To the 'W' character (note the capital letters)
    |   The 'd' key is mapped to vi-delete-object
    |   vi-delete-object maps the 't' key to vi-delete-to-char
    |   vi-delete-to-char contains Leo commands to perform the vi command.

    Macros modes:
    | Most vi commands do not have an equivalent Leo command.  Instead, a
    | series of Leo commands must be issued to emulate the vi command.
    | The Leo commands needed to emulate a vi command are placed in a
    | single @mode node.

Code limitations:
    Current character:
    | Vi implementation normally use two different "current character"
    | designators depending on the current state.

        Insert state:
        | In the Insert state, a vertical bar is placed between two
        | characters to indicate where the next key will be inserted.
        | Leo's cursor is of this type.

        Command state: 
        | In the Command state, vi expects that the cursor is highlighting
        | a current character and provides commands to enter the insert
        | state or paste text either before or after that current
        | character.  Leo's vi emulation currently does not support a
        | "current character" cursor. As a result, inserting and pasting
        | before or after is replaced by inserting or pasting "at" the
        | current cursor location.  For example, the 'i' and 'a' command
        | are both mapped to enter the insert state at the current cursor
        | location.

    Conditional code execution:
    | No conditional command invocation exits.  Instead, conditional
    | branching is replace by setup commands that insure that, regardless
    | of current state, the command performs correctly.  For example,
    | Beginning-of-line command will go to previous line if called when
    | cursor is at beginning of line.  Vi requires that '|' always goes to
    | beginning of current line.  Problme is solved by issueing
    | forward-char command to insure cursor is moved off of the beginning
    | of the line before beginning-of-line command is issued.

    Commands requesting user input:
    | Commands getting user input must be the last command within the
    | mode.  See "Commands getting user input" in Problems section below.

    Edit headings using modes:
    | Commands modifying or selecting headline text do not work correctly
    | within a mode.  See "Editing headlines within modes" in Problems
    | section below.  This eliminates accurate implementation of vi's
    | delete/change/substitute/yank object commands.  Instead, the
    | commands are modified to only select text.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20080624093059.50">Binding numeric keys:
| Mapping a number to a command or mode prevents the number from being
| entered as text while in the insert state.

Binding '?' key:
| No response when key pressed.

Binding 'bksp' key:
| Binding 'bksp' key to back-char to move back a character in command mode
| prevents 'bksp' from deleting characters in text edit mode.

Commands getting user input:
| Commands requesting user input must be the last command executed.  These
| commands include: find-character and zap-to-character.

Editing headlines within modes:
| Text editing commands do not work within modes assigned to outline key
| mappings.

Undo command:
| The 'undo' command sometimes does not work when returning to a node's
| command mode.  Moving to another node fixes the problem.(i.e. delete-char, set-insert-state, ...)

Matching bracket command:
| Performs bracket matching on Body text when in node's headline command
| state.

Word definition:
| "Word" related commands determine boundries of a word differently.

Toggle case:
| Leo provides support for switching to upper or lower case but no method |
| exists to toggle between cases.

Find settings
| Leo commands only allow toggling of search settings.  If specific "set"
| and "clear" search setting commands were available then searches from the
| body pane could be restricted to the body pane and searches from the
| outline could be restricted to the outline.
Forward and backward sentences:
| Leo's forwardSentenceHelper and backSentenceHelper functions do not stop
| at empty lines nor do they skip over periods within words nor do they stop
| at sentences ending in non-periods nor do they stop at the end or
| beginning of the buffer.

Focus to Body pane:
| Leo functions exist which unconditionally set focus to the body pane
| regardless of the active pane.
    deleteTab() function:
        | Issuing "--&gt; exit-named-mode" calls "endMode" function which calls
        | "c.frame.log.deleteTab('Mode')" function which sets the focus to the
        | body pane.  

Displaying mode help:
| The "--&gt; mode-help" command displays all mapped keys using a capitol
| letter regardless of the actual binding.
    Recommendations:
    | To better support narrow tab cards, display the mode's label without
    | the "enter-" and "-mode" text and place key label before mode label.
    | Results in change from:
    |                enter-vi-delete-line-mode D
    |    enter-vi-delete-to-begin-of-word-mode B 
    | to:
    |    D : vi-delete-line
    |    B : vi-delete-to-begin-of-word</t>
<t tx="ekr.20080624093059.51">Yank vs. Yank
| A vi "yank" operation copies the selected text TO the clipboard.
| A Leo "yank" operation inserts text FROM the clipboard.

copy-text in modes:
| Leo's copy-text does not work within a mode.  As a result, all "copy to
| clipboard" capability is being implemented using kill-&lt;object&gt; command
| followed by a "yank" command.

paste-text in modes:
| paste-text in modes does not work.  Use Leo's "yank" instead.

delete-node does not copy node to clipboard:
| Issue copy-node command followed by delete-node</t>

<t tx="ekr.20080624093059.53">These are now treated much like empty @auto nodes</t>
<t tx="ekr.20080628062747.69">http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/794ca596f7c58ae5

The fix was to call c.redraw_now in undo() and redo().  This allows the undo interlock to work.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20080628062747.70">Minor nit - insert-file to load a file into a node, text appears in the
body pane.  Without doing anything else to the body pane click on
another node.  Inserted text is lost - body for node is empty.  As long
as you move the cursor into the body frame and press a key after
inserting the contents, it's retained.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20080628062747.71">@nocolor

c.beginUpdate()
try:
 add / change icons on some nodes
 c.setChanged(True)
finally:
 c.endUpdate()

seems not to give a redraw *after* a script button is pressed.

It does give one before the action is taken, so pressing the button
twice shows the change.

EKR: The fix was to mod_scripting.py.

@color</t>
<t tx="ekr.20080628062747.72">The fix was a major addition to p._adjustPositionBeforeUnlink.

Report:

Run this script:

t = p.insertAfter()
c.setHeadString(t, 'test node 1')
t = t.insertAfter()
c.setHeadString(t, 'test node 2')
t = t.insertAfter()
c.setHeadString(t, 'test area')
for i in range(200):
   n = t.insertAsLastChild()
   c.setHeadString(n, str(i))
   if i == 3: x = n

for i in range(100):
   n = x.insertAsLastChild()
   c.setHeadString(n, str(i+500))

t.expand()

It creates an outline, you might need to click on the node from which
the script was run to see what was added.  It should look like this:

test node 1
test node 2
test area
   1
   2
  +3
   4
   5
   etc.

Now, use the mouse to drag test node 1 down to a position after node
4... for me at least this results in the outline view leaping to the
bottom of the tree, which it shouldn't do.

Scroll back up to the top, and drag test node 2 down to a position
after node 4, this time no leap.

It appears that the first time you drag something into the test area it
reacts as if 3 is expanded and repositions to allow for all those
actually not visible lines, but the second time you drag something in
it's ok, as if it has an accurate count on visible lines now.

Leo 4.5 beta 2 is now available at:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3458&amp;package_id=29106

Leo 4.5 contains many important new features.  See below for details.

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.5:
--------------------------

- Full support for @shadow files in Leo's core.
- Major improvements to Leo's key binding code.
- The beginning of usable vim-like bindings.
- uA's may now be associated with vnodes in @thin and @shadow files.
- Several magor reorganizations of Leo's code:
  including sax-based parsing, support for the Graph world (unified nodes),
  simplified drawing code.
- Leo is now an installable package.
- Prepared code to be ready for Python 3.0.
- Many small improvements and bug fixes.

    @settings--&gt;File options--&gt;Shadow files

  The defaults for these settings are::

    @string shadow_prefix = x
    @string shadow_subdir = .leo_shadow

- Added support for @bool fixedWindow option. Leo suppresses marks, expansion
  state, orphan bits and current position bits when writing fixed .leo files. As
  a result, all nodes will be collapsed and the root node will always be
  selected when Leo opens a fixed .leo file.

  You can optionally specify the size and position on the screen of fixed .leo
  files by putting an '@data fixedWindowPosition' node in the
  @settings tree of myLeoSettings.leo or leoSettings.leo.  You should
  **not** put such a node in the fixed .leo file itself--everyone who
  opens the file would get that fixed position.

  The body of the '@data fixedWindowPosition' node should contain
  something like this::

    # Must be four entries: width,height,left,top.
    # Put this in myLeoSettings.leo, **not** in individual .leo files.

<t tx="ekr.20080806211440.253">- Leo now uses a sax-based parser to read .leo files.
  This makes it possible to extend Leo's file format without invalidating previous versions of Leo.

- Leo now supports the so-called 'Graph World'.
  When g.unified_nodes is True, Leo moves all information from tnodes into vnodes.

- Leo now uses a new key binding scheme.
  This allows substantially simpler key bindings. Indeed, most per-pane bindings
  have been eliminated.
  Added support for kill bindings.

- Leo is now an installable package.
  To make this work, Leo adds os.curdir to sys.path if needed on startup.

- Reorganized Leo's drawing and focus code.
  As a result, calls to c.beginUpdate and c.endUpdate are no longer needed.

- Leo is now ready for Python 3.x:
  Change most print statements to calls to g.pr.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20080806211440.256">- Added g.Tracer class.  This is a Python 'debugger' that computes a call graph.
  To trace a function and its callers, put the following at the function's start::

    g.startTracer()

- The find-character command now finds characters across line boundaries.

- Set cwd in read/write commands. This affect the following commands:
  open, save, save-as, save-to, read-outline-only, read-file-into-node,
  write-file-from-node and all the import/export commands.

- Leo creates the .leo folder in the user's HOME directory, and puts several configuration files there.
  Leo looks for myLeoSettings.leo in HOME/.leo.
  Leo uses os.path.expanduser("~") if there is no home setting.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20080902080930.4">- Leo now uses a sax-based parser to read .leo files.
  This makes it possible to extend Leo's file format without invalidating previous versions of Leo.
  
- Leo now supports the so-called 'Graph World'.
  When g.unified_nodes is True, Leo moves all information from tnodes into vnodes.
  
- Leo now uses a new key binding scheme.
  This allows substantially simpler key bindings. Indeed, most per-pane bindings
  have been eliminated.
  Added support for kill bindings.
  
- Leo is now an installable package.
  To make this work, Leo adds os.curdir to sys.path if needed on startup.
  
- Reorganized Leo's drawing and focus code.
  As a result, calls to c.beginUpdate and c.endUpdate are no longer needed.
  
- Leo is now ready for Python 3.x:
  Change most print statements to calls to g.pr.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20080902080930.5">- Added g.Tracer class.  This is a Python 'debugger' that computes a call graph.
  To trace a function and its callers, put the following at the function's start::

    g.startTracer()
  
- The find-character command now finds characters across line boundaries.

- Set cwd in read/write commands. This affect the following commands:
  open, save, save-as, save-to, read-outline-only, read-file-into-node,
  write-file-from-node and all the import/export commands.

- Added support for @args list for @button nodes.
  See the docstring for the mod_scripting plugin for details.
  
- Leo creates the .leo folder in the user's HOME directory, and puts several configuration files there.
  Leo looks for myLeoSettings.leo in HOME/.leo.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20080902080930.6">- The default settings for @shadow files are now located in leoSettings.leo in the node::

    @settings--&gt;File options--&gt;Shadow files
    
  The defaults for these settings are::

    @string shadow_prefix = x
    @string shadow_subdir = .leo_shadow

- Added support for @bool fixedWindow option. Leo suppresses marks, expansion
  state, orphan bits and current position bits when writing fixed .leo files. As
  a result, all nodes will be collapsed and the root node will always be
  selected when Leo opens a fixed .leo file.
  
  You can optionally specify the size and position on the screen of fixed .leo
  files by putting an '@data fixedWindowPosition' node in the
  @settings tree of myLeoSettings.leo or leoSettings.leo.  You should
  **not** put such a node in the fixed .leo file itself--everyone who
  opens the file would get that fixed position.

  The body of the '@data fixedWindowPosition' node should contain
  something like this::

    # Must be four entries: width,height,left,top.
    # Put this in myLeoSettings.leo, **not** in individual .leo files.
    
    1200
    800
    50
    50

- Added @bool cleo_color_ignore = True
  This determines whether cleo colors @ignore headlines. The default is True.
  
- Added @bool suppress_import_parsing setting
  When True, @auto and @shadow import the entire file into a single node.</t>

Who am I? Want the best tools.  Want to know everything about computers.

Who is the typical Leo user?  Me, LeoUser, Ville, Bernhard Mulder.  We have been fascinated with computers our whole lives, we know that computers are still in their infancy, we have ideas for making them better.

Why is Leo fun?  Because I get to express directly what is typically hidden--the deep structure of a program, class or method.  Because this structure is explict, the structure itself is part of what I do.  It's a situation similar to an artist that is given a new color to play with, or even a new medium of expression.

How did I discover Leo?  I created Leo because I had a hard time understanding so-called Literate Programs.  LP was supposed to make programming easier by making it possible to write truly useful documentation.  The thought was that voluminous documentation would clarify the organization of large programs.  LP had other features that were also supposed to help.  Chief among them were so-called sections.  These were like macros, functions or methods in that they could be involked by name.  However, I found that in some ways LP actually made understanding program more difficult.  I couldn't remember the documentation, and mere words did not convey the interrelationships between all the various parts of a program.</t>

New: needs work.

Leo is, among many other things, a super-duper filing cabinet. Not only can Leo
hold lots of data, but Leo allows you to file information in multiple places.
You don't have choose one "correct" way of organizing data; you can "file" the
same datum in multiple places.

These kinds of strengths make Leo ideal for the typical user of IPython who uses
IPython to run scientific experiments. Leo can hold all kinds of lab notes:
scripts, parameters to the scripts, output of experiments, notes, ideas,
whatever. Indeed, Leo offers IPython users an alternative to the command-line
way of executing scripts: Leo's nodes provide a natural way to create long-lived
scripts and their variants.

Similarly, IPython offers many features for Leo users, including clever
enhancements to the Python shell and full integration with tools such as
mathplotlib.

Several years ago the IPython community started work on what they called an
IPython Notebook. I immediately saw that Leo would *be* an excellent IPython
Notebook if Leo and IPython could be made to work together. However, the task of
integrating IPython into Leo seemed daunting: IPython's shell only *appears*
simple: it actually is a sophisticated execution environment capable of running
numerous scripts in separate processes. A little experimention seemed to
indicate that it would be a major project to make IPython work with Leo's event
loop.

This is how matters stood until March 2008. In response to a query on the
IPython newsgroup, Ville Vainio started helping me with the task of embedding
IPython into Leo. The task turned out to be far easier than I had dared hoped. I
think Ville too was pleasantly surprised. I kept raising issues, and Ville kept
saying, "It's not really a problem".

In less than two weeks we had a way for IPython to communicate intimately with
Leo, and vice versa. Leo's event loop runs simulaniously with IPython's event
without either interfering with the other. Once this initial bridge was in
place, Ville improved it in several ways. Leo's ILeo plugin is the result.

Original: still good


ILeo, or leo-ipython bridge, creates a two-way communication channel between Leo
and IPython. The level of integration is much deeper than conventional
integration in IDEs; most notably, you are able to store and manipulate **data**
in Leo nodes, in addition to mere program code - essentially making ILeo a
hierarchical spreadsheet, albeit with non-grid view of the data. The
possibilities of this are endless, and the approach can be applied in wide range
of problem domains with very little actual coding.

IPython users are accustomed to using things like %edit to produce non-trivial
functions/classes (i.e. something that they don't want to enter directly on the
interactive prompt, but creating a proper script/module involves too much
overhead). In ILeo, this task consists just going to the Leo window, creating a
node and writing the code there, and pressing alt+I (push-to-ipython).

Obviously, you can save the Leo document as usual - this is a great advantage of
ILeo over using %edit, you can save your experimental scripts all at one time,
without having to organize them into script/module files (before you really want
to, of course!)

<t tx="ekr.20090101095717.3">@nocolor-node

Leo's source code is a collection of classes, along with utility functions in
``leoGlobals.py``. Here are the classes and objects that scripts will commonly use:

**g.app**
    The **application object** representing the entire Leo application.
    The ivars (instance variables) of ``g.app`` represent Leo's global variables.
    
**g.app.gui**
    This is a wrapper class that shields Leo's core code from gui-dependent details.
    As described below, scripts can invoke dialogs using g.app.gui convenience methods.

**commander**
    An instance of the ``Commands`` class in ``leoCommands.py``.
    Commanders represent commands for a *particular* window.
    Each open Leo window has its own commander.
    By convention, any variable named ``c`` is a commander.

**frame**
    An instance of the base ``leoFrame`` class in ``leoFrame.py``.
    Frames contains all the internal data needed to manage a Leo window.
    Given a commander ``c``, ``c.frame`` is commanders frame.
    Given a frame ``f``, ``f.c`` is the frame's commander.

**position**
    An instance of the ``position`` class in ``leoNodes.py``.
    A position object represents the location of a particular node *in a tree traversal*.
    By convention, variables named ``p``, ``p1`` or ``p2`` are positions.
    For any ``position`` ``p``, ``p.v`` is the vnode at that position and
    ``p.v.t`` is the tnode at that position.
    **Positions are the primary way to access data.**
    ``c.currentPosition`` and ``c.rootPosition`` return positions.
    From those starting point, it is possible to access the data in any node.

    **Important**:
    Positions can become *invalid* when the structure of the outline changes.
    As discussed below, plugins and scripts that store positions for use at a later time should make sure the
    position p is still valid by calling c.positionExists(p)

    **Important**:
    For compatibility with old (pre-4.2) scripts, ``c.currentVnode`` and
    ``c.rootVnode`` methods return *positions* not vnodes. Old scripts appear to
    be using vnodes; in fact they are using positions. I call such scripts
    **confused** scripts. Confused scripts work because the ``position`` class
    is designed to make them work. We'll see how this works in detail in `About
    copying positions`_.  This section is **supremely important**.

**vnode**
    An instance of the ``vnode`` class in ``leoNodes.py``.
    vnodes represent one or more outline nodes on the screen.
    Normally, scripts access vnodes via the ``position`` class described below. 
    By convention, variables named ``v``, ``v1`` or ``v2`` refer to vnodes.
    **Important**: scripts normally should use positions, not vnodes.

**tnode**
    An instance of the ``tnode`` class in ``leoNodes.py``.
    tnodes represent the actual data in a vnode, including headline and body text.
    For any vnode ``v``, ``v.t`` is v's tnode.
    Cloned vnodes v1 and v2 share the same tnode.  That is ``v1.t == v2``.
    **Important**: If ``p`` is a ``position``, ``p.v.t`` is the tnode associated with that position.
    Many positions may share the same tnode.
    
**Important**: With the exception of the p.v and v.t ivars, scripts should be
careful to use only the methods of the position, vnode and tnode classes rather
than the internal ivars of these classes. Doing so will ensure that the script
is as simple as possible and that the script will continue to work regardless of
future changes to the internals of these classes.

Leo is fun because (among other things) it is *really* easy to write scripts that manipulate data in Leo's outlines. It's dead easy to find nodes, to apply a
script to some or all of the nodes in a Leo outline to insert and delete nodes, to move nodes, and to change the contents of nodes. This chapter will show you
how to do all this, and more.

Working on nodes is *much* easier than working on external files. There is no need to open the file or read it; all of Leo's nodes are always available.

So the first thing to understand about scripting with Leo is that scripts can act on nodes.

The second thing to understand about scripting with Leo is that scripts can be composed *from* nodes. That is, you can use Leo's outlines structure to organize
scripts themselves. In other words, you can use the same features (@others and sections) to organize your scripts that you use to create external files. In
fact, Leo's execute-script command creates a script the same way Leo's save commands write external files. The only difference is that the created file is written to a string that is then passed to Python's exec function.

After covering these basics, this chapter will discuss two totally cool ways of using these basic features.

The first is, by far, the most clever scripting trick I have ever seen. (I can say that because I didn't invent it :-) The inventor (who goes by the name 'e'),
calls it "bringing scripts to data". Leo's scripting plugin lets you associate a script (in the outline) with a **script button** in Leo's icon button. Pressing
the button applies the script **to the presently selected outline node**. We'll see how this works in detail later. BTW, you can invoke script buttons without
using the mouse using using keyboard shortcuts or minibuffer commands.

The second scripting trick isn't so immediately spectacular, but it too can be used in clever ways. By convention, the headline of a node can tell scripts
the kind (type) of data in a node. For example, @test indicates that a node (and its descendants) contains a unit test, while @graph might indicate that a nodes represents an arbitrary directed graph.

@test is an excellent example of the power lurking behind this simple idea.  Leo's core supports @test nodes. Leo's run-unit-tests command searches the selected outline looking for @test
nodes. For each such node, the run-unit-tests command *creates* a valid unit test (subclass of UnitTest.TestCase) by (in effect) wrapping the body text of
the node in an instance of UnitTest.TestCase. (It doesn't actually work that way, but the idea is the same). So you don't have write::
    
    class myTestClass (UnitTest.TestCase): def run(): assert(pi==3) def
        shortDescription (self): return 'pi'
    
Instead you just create a node::
    
    - @test pi assert(pi=3)
    
This saves a lot of tedious typing.

Why, oh why, would anyone be interested in Leo? After all, Emacs and Vim are 
superb text editors, and Visual Studio and Eclipse are great IDE's. How can Leo possibly compete with such strong competition? What does Leo offer that these other tools don't? 

Leo does have something unique to offer--something missing from Emacs,Vim, Visual Studio and Eclipse. Leo's users often speak of an Aha! moment when they understand what this 'something' is. 
The Aha! arises from considering programs, design and data in a new light. You might call this 'The Leo Way'. In essence, Leo shows that computer programs, designs and data are *not*, after all, mostly about text. Yes, people usually *express* programs, designs and data as text. Yes, people manipulate programs, designs and data *using* text, but *text is not the whole story*. 

In The Leo Way, text is simply a manifestation (a shadow) of something more 
fundamental. That 'something else' might be called 'organization' or 'structure' or 'views' or even 'architecture'. However, let us use the term **node** to represent the fundamental unit of structure in Leo. We'll see why in a moment. 

In architectural terms, nodes are bricks that make up a building. In computer
programming terms, nodes make up methods, classes, files and entire
applications. So the term 'node' does *not* have a fixed meaning--it is simply a
unit of organization. Any node can be built from other nodes, and any node can
be used by any other node. Leo represent nodes directly, as nodes (headlines) in
an outline. An outline node contains a headline and body text. The **outline
pane** shows all headlines; the **body pane** shows the body text of the
presently selected node.
 
**Outline structure is real data**
 
To repeat: the fundamental unit in Leo is *not* text. True, headlines and body *consist* of text, but a node is just not text, it is a true (Python) object. This means several specific things: 
 
1. Because nodes are true objects, Leo commands understand what a node is, and
   where a node fits into the entire outline. I'll say more about outline
   organization soon, but let me give an example. Every node has exactly one
   parent node, (except for top-level nodes that have no parents) and every node
   has zero or more children and zero or more siblings. A node's parent,
   children and siblings are real properties of the node, *completely
   independent* of the node's headline or body text. Furthermore, any of Leo's
   commands (or user-written scripts or plugins, the big sisters of user
   scripts.) can *easily* access the all aspects of an outline *without* having
   to parse any text whatsoever. Commands, scripts and plugins can easily do the
   following: get the root of the outline, the presently selected node in the
   outline, the parent, siblings, children or descendants of any node in the
   outline, etc., etc. Commands, scripts and plugins can easily insert, delete
   or move nodes, and can alter the headline or body text in any node. All this
   *without* parsing text.
 
2. Having nodes be true objects means that commands scripts and plugins can
   treat the headline text as *something truly different from* body text. The
   natural interpretation of headline text is as a description of the body text.
   This is important! Headlines often control Leo's commands. For example,
   headlines that start with @thin, @file, @asis, @auto, etc. serve to guide and
   control Leo's read and write commands. Headlines that start with @test,
   @suite and @mark-for-unit-tests guide Leo's unit testing commands. Moreover,
   it is easy to create new conventions for headlines that control user-written
   scripts or plugins. For example, plugins define specific meanings for
   headlines that start with @url, @rst, @bookmark, @slideshow, etc., etc. So
   the separation of headline and body text, **as true components of a node
   object**, is a very big deal.
 
3. One application of these ideas deserves special mention. Leo's scripting
   plugin provides support for @button nodes. The headline is @button
   &lt;command-name&gt;. The body text contains a script. When Leo opens a Leo
   outline, each @button node creates a command and an icon. Clicking the icon
   (or executing the command) applies the script in the @button node **to the
   presently selected outline**. That is, the script is executed in a context in
   which it is easy to get access to all aspects of the outline in which the
   script is embedded. This is a major advance in scripting. It allows you to
   'bring scripts to data', i.e., any part of an outline. In particular, it is
   very easy to create **editing scripts** that automate what would otherwise be
   boring and repetitive editing tasks.
 
**Leo outlines aren't your average outline**
 
Earlier I said that *any* node can be built from other nodes, and *any* node can be used by any other node. It takes a very special kind of outline for this to be possible. In a typical outline, such as Emacs outline mode, for example, nodes appear exactly once in the outline. This makes it impossible to 'reuse' nodes in multiple places. Leo removes that limitation: any outline node can be **cloned**, and clones can appear in as many places in an outline as you like. 
 
Cloned nodes are distinct: they must be distinct so they can be moved throughout the outline, but **cloned nodes share all their information**. That is, changing the headline or body text in a node instantly changes the headline and body text in all the other nodes cloned to it. Furthermore, similar remarks apply to the children and descendants of any node--changing any child (or other descendant) of a node, say node A, instantly makes corresponding changes to all nodes cloned to node A. 
 
Earlier I said that you can think of nodes as representing 'organization' or 
'structure' or 'views' or even 'architecture'. Clones are the crucial feature that allows this point of view. For example, we can build up multiple 'views' of data in an outline using clones as follows: 
 
- Create a 'view node' that will represent a *user-specified* view. 
 
- Clone all nodes that are to be part of the view, and move them so that each clone is a child of the view node. 
 
That's about all there is to it. The view node, and its children *is* a new view of the outline. This notion of 'view' is so important that Leo supports it directly. Leo's **chapters** are simply views created as I have just described. When you select one chapter, you only see the nodes of that chapter in Leo's outline pane. 
 
**Conclusions &amp; encouragements**
 
So Leo offers a new way to understand, organize and manipulate *any* kind of
complex data, including computer programs, *designs* of computer programs, web
sites, personal data, whatever. The Aha that I invite you to experience is this:
Outlines are more than mere eye candy. Having organization be real data creates
an entirely new dimension, literally and figuratively, in computer programming,
computer design and data organization, including web-site design, database
design, etc. Leo's commands use headline and body text in many creative ways. So
can you and your scripts. It's easy, it's fun, and it's revolutionary.

That's about it, except for some words of caution and advice: 
 
1. Leo has been under active development for over 10 years. The new world
   created by nodes is rich and varied. You won't learn it all in a day or so.
   Please be patient. Start by learning Leo's basic features as explained in the
   tutorial. You can learn more advanced features later.
 
2. Those of you who are comfortable with Emacs should feel pretty much at home
   with Leo. Leo has shamelessly stolen the best features of Emacs, including
   the minibuffer and many Emacs-like commands.
 
3. For those of you who are *not* comfortable with Emacs, please understand that
   you do *not* need to understand all of Leo's commands in order to use Leo.
   Start by ignoring the minibuffer. Later, the minibuffer can become your
   friend, but you can get the Aha! without it.

<t tx="ekr.20090101095717.6">Leo is not your ordinary text editor, class browser, project manager or database manager,
though it resembles these programs in some respects.
Understanding what Leo is does take some work:
many people have reported an 'Aha!' experience when they first understand what Leo is all about.

Leo is built on simple foundations:
    
- Leo is an outliner. All Leo data resides in an `outline`_. Outlines can
  contain text, computer programs, web sites, pictures, or any other kind of
  data. Leo can show such information, including pictures and movies, directly
  in the outline.
  
- Using `cloned nodes`_, you can put the same information (outline node) in
  multiple places. You don't have to decide, once and for all, where the 'right'
  place to put data: you can 'file' information in as many places as you like.
  But Leo is more than just the ultimate filing cabinet. Using clones, an
  outline can, in effect, show multiple views of the data *in that outline*.
  Again, you do not have to decide, once and for all, which is the 'right' view.
  You can have as many views as you like. For example, suppose you have an
  outline that contains all of your slides (or links to them.) Using clones, any
  of your slides could appear in as many slideshows as you like.

These features allow you to organize personal information such as web links or
pictures. Other features make Leo a powerful environment for programming and web
development:
    
- Unlike most file and class browsers, Leo has a memory. Leo allows you complete
  freedom to organizer and reorganize your outline as you like. Leo remembers
  the organization and expansion state of your outline when you save it, and
  restores the outline and expansion state when you reload the outline.
    
- Leo is a virtual file system and data manager. Leo can generate files based on
  data contained in outline. Such `derived files`_ can contain anything that the
  outline contains: text, computer programs, pictures, etc.
  
- You can use outlines to organize your programs, data and scripts. Using a
  markup language based on noweb_, you can easily tell Leo how to assemble
  programs and scripts from text in a portion of an outline.
  
- Leo's import commands convert already-existing programs into Leo pre-organized
  outlines, much like class browsers do. Unlike class browsers, you are then
  free to reorganize the outline so that it is easy to understand. This is a
  great way to study other people's programs.
  
- The structure of Leo outlines is directly accessible to Python scripts.
  Scripts can directly access all nodes (headlines and body text) of an outline.
  There is no need to 'parse' data into constituent parts. Furthermore scripts
  can easily insert, delete and move nodes. For example, unit tests can create
  nodes that represent the expected result of a unit test.

- Any Leo script can easily be applied to a selected part of the outline. This
  is an incredibly powerful and flexible feature. For example, it is very easy
  to create 'text editing' scripts that automate tedious, repetitive programming
  tasks.
  
- It is easy to write `plugins`_ to alter any aspect of Leo's operation. Dozens
  of plugins already exist.
  
- Nodes naturally represent both data (body text) and its description or
  meta-data (headline). By convention, many plugins and commands look for
  headlines of the form @x. Examples include @test and @suite for unit tests,
  @url for web links, @slideshow and @slide for groups of slides, @auto for
  automatically imported files, @folder for nodes created automatically from a
  folder on the computer's file system, and many others.
  Two kinds of meta-data deserve special mention. Unit tests can easily define
  their own meta-data, such as 'before' and 'after'. These data describe the
  initial conditions of the unit tests and the expected result.
  The @rst plugin uses various kinds of @rst nodes to organize
  `reStructuredText`_ and to control how that text is organized. For full
  details, see `Chapter 14: Using the Rst3 Plugin`_.
  
- Leo coexists well with other editors such as Emacs and Vim. Leo has
  several plugins that allow you easily to switch between Emacs (or Vim) and
  Leo. Moreover, Leo allows you complete flexibility to use the key bindings you
  like.
  
Several people have asked me, "How can Leo help me with programming?".
Here is a short answer that summarizes the discussion so far:
    
- Leo's outlines allow you to see the organization of complex programs more
  clearly than with any other tool.
  
- Leo's allows you to organize programs and scripts more flexibly than with any
  other tool. In particular, noweb is a perfect match for outlines.
  
- Leo scripts are much more powerful than in other scripting environments
  because Leo scripts have easy access to headlines and data without having to
  parse data. **Outline structure is real data**: scripts can easily access the
  parents and descendants of any node. The practical benefits are almost
  endless.

- You can do things with Leo that are not possible with Emacs or Vim. In fact,
  you can do things with Leo that are not even *conceivable or expressible* with
  Emacs or Vim.

One last word. Leo has a strong and active community of users on `SourceForge`_.
Working with this community has been a constant source of joy and inspiration.
Suggestions and plugins from users continue to drive Leo in excellent new
directions. Who knows what the next plugin will bring? -- Edward K. Ream</t>

Leo was born in an attempt to understand a relatively obscure programming technique called Literate Programming.

Using Leo is fun.  Fun because it gives control, and because programming occurs in an expanded context.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090219024526.1">@nocolor</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090219024526.2">A **node** is the combination of a headline (in the outline pane) and its
associated body text. *A node is a real Python object*. Each node has an unique
identity. Nodes persist. *When you save a Leo outline to a file, you are saving
the outline's nodes*.

You could say that nodes are what make Leo unique. In fancier language, **Leo
has a DOM** (Document Object Model). *Leo treats data as true objects, having
inherent structure*. In Leo, nothing is "just" text. It is, at minimum, **text
in context** (the context of a node, and the context of the node's position in
the outline.)

Leo creates a new way of understanding data. We call this change of perspective
**the Leo way**. The consequences of this new view of data are wide ranging.
Let's start with the simplest example.

*Any node can contain a Leo (Python) script*. Leo's execute-script command
(Ctrl-b by default) executes the script (in the body text) using Python's exec
statement. The exec statement pre-defines three variables: c, g and p. **c** is
the **commander** of the outline. Naturally, a commander is a real Python
object, with many methods useful to scripts. **g** is Leo's **leoGlobals**
module containing many utility functions of use to scripts.

**p** is the **position** of the presently selected node in the outline at the
time the script is executed. **Positions are themselves Python objects**, with
many useful methods and attributes. Given a position p, **p.h** is the node's
headline text and **p.b** is the node's body text. Nodes can have any kind and
amount of data, called user data, **p.u**. Scripts can set headline, body and
user data by assigning data to p.b, p.h and p.h. Scripts can assign any data to
p.u providing the data is pickleable.

You can access all data in an outline using iterators defined in commander. For
example, c.allNodes_iter returns every position in the outline in **outline
order** (the order in which nodes would appear in the outline if all headlines
were expanded). For example, the following script::

    for p in c.allNodes_iter:
        print p.level() * ' ',p.h

prints all headlines of all nodes of the outline, in outline order, indented to
show their hierarchical relationships with parent or child nodes.

Note: p.level() is a method of the position class. It returns 0 for top-level
nodes, 1 for their children, 2 for their grandchildren. There are many other
useful methods of the position class...

The next section [Scripting Leo: Node Types and @test] discusses some of Leo's
most powerful and unique features.</t>

.. |leoMainWindow| image:: http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/LeoQtWindow.bmp

At first glance, Leo looks similar to other editors and IDE's. 

|leoMainWindow|

At the top of the screen is an **icon area** containing buttons or other
widgets. Leo's **plugins** (Python scripts) may add items to the icon area.

At the bottom of the screen, Leo has a **minibuffer** into which you can type
**minibuffer commands**, just as in Emacs_. Leo typically uses Emacs-like
command names, like execute-script or close-window. Like Emacs, you can type the
command name in the minibuffer, and like Emacs, you can use tab completion,
shown in a tab in the **log pane**. Of course, you can also execute commands
from menus. As we shall see, you can use special-purpose Leo outlines to change
menus however you like.

Leo's **outline pane** appears below the icon area, to the left of the log pane.
The outline pane contains **headlines**. Double-click the headline or type
Ctrl-h to edit a headline. The **icon box** is a small icon just to the left of
the headline. The icon box shows the nodes attributes. A red vertical bar
indicates a node is marked. A small arrow indicates the node is a clone. A
darker box indicates that the node has been changed. A small square indicates
that the node has body text.

Below the outline pane lies the **body pane**. The body pane shows the **body
text** associated with the presently selected headline. A **node** consists of a
headline, its associated body text, and optional **user data**. We'll say much
more about nodes in [Scripting Leo: Commanders, Nodes and Positions].

**Note**: It is natural to use the word "outline" in three ways. First, what is
shown in the outline pane. Second, the entire collection of nodes (See the next
section) in a **Leo outline file** (.leo file). Third, the .leo file itself.
This slightly ambiguous usage typically causes no confusion.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090219024526.4">Now we come to an extraordinary consequence of the Leo way. We said above that
the execute-script command executes the script in body text in the context of
the c, g and p variables. But *p is not necessarily the node containing the
script!* You can define a script in one node, create a minibuffer command
associated with that script. You then select another node of the outline and
apply the command to the outline. Thus, *you can apply any script in any Leo
node to any part of an outline*. We call this **bringing scripts to data**.

You can associate key-bindings with any script, and you can create **script
buttons** in Leo's icon area that will execute a script on the presently
selected outline. By the way, script buttons are dynamic. If you change the
script button's script, the new script will be used the next time you push the
script button (or execute the corresponding minibuffer command, or press the key
bound to the script button).

There is another aspect of the Leo way (that is, another change of perspective),
that makes Leo's data amazingly flexible. This second change in attitude is
this:

    **We can consider that a headline describe a node's data**.

That is, a node (it's body text, user data, and internal data managed by Leo) is
the data. *The headline is the node's* **metadata**. Because nodes are true
Python objects, this association of data with metadata is secure. It can not be
broken by editing text, say.

But headlines can be much more than a simple, human-readable description.
*Scripts can assign types to nodes* (and their descendants). By convention (it's
only a convention, it is not built into Leo) headlines that start with '@' have
special meaning to scripts, including Leo's own predefined commands.

For example, Leo's **core** (the standard part of Leo that is available to all
plugins), creates support for **@test nodes**. The headline is @test &lt;test
name&gt;. The body text is any Python script. As always, when executing the script
Leo predefines the c, g and p variables. You can, in fact, use the
execute-script command on @test nodes. Nothing special will happen.

However, you can run the run-unit-tests-locally (Alt-4) command on a (part of)
an outline containing one or more @test nodes. This command converts all @test
nodes to subclasses of Python's Unittest.TestCase class, and runs the result.
(To see the results, you would typically run Leo in a console.)

This is extraordinarily convenient. You don't have to type (or look at) the
blah-blah-blah that wraps most typical unit tests. For example, in an @test
node, a single assert statement can make up a complete unit test.

Furthermore, scripts in @test nodes can use outline nodes as data for the unit
tests. Most of Leo's unit tests are in the file leo/test/unitTest.leo. Many of
these tests are associated with data trees, like 'input', 'output' and 'work'.
The unit test applies an operation to the data in the input tree using the work
tree as a scratch area. The unit test then simply asserts that the expected
output in the output tree matches the actual result in the work tree. Nothing
could be simpler, or more flexible.

Earlier, I said that scripts can assign types to nodes. The "type" is simply the
start of the headline, like @test, @url, @picture etc. **Scripts create the
meaning of types**. There is nothing magic about this. What a node type means is
completely determined by the script that handles such nodes. Thus, *node types
are completely flexible and extensible*. Leo has many predefined node types, the
most important being **@auto**, **@file**, **@thin** and **@shadow**.</t>

This tutorial introduces Leo's basic features.  It has 8 parts:

1. [Outlines and Nodes]

   In brief: outlines consist of **nodes**.
   Nodes consist of **headlines**, **body text** and optional **user data**.
   User data is available to scripts, but is not visible in the outline.

2. [Clones and Views]

   In brief: A **Clone** is a "live" copy of a node.
   Using clones, any node may appear in many places in the outline.
   A view is a node containing other nodes, including clones.
   Thus, an outline can contain arbitrarily many views of the data it contains.
   You never need to choose between different views of your data.  You can have them all.

3. [External Files]

   In brief:
   **@auto**, **@file**, **@shadow** and **@thin** nodes (and their descendants) manage **external files**.
   @file and @thin nodes **create** external files containing special comments called **sentinels**.
   Using @thin is recommended whenever possible.
   External files managed with @shadow and @auto contain no sentinels--Leo automatically
   imports the external file when reading a .leo file.

4. [First Steps for Newbies]

   In brief: Leo's ``File:Open`` command creates @edit nodes.
   These nodes are much like Emacs_ or vim_ buffers.
   Leo settings files allow total control over settings.

5. [The rst3 and ipython plugins]

   In brief: The rst3 plugin integrates outline structure with reStructuredText_.
   The ipython plugin allows Leo scripts to control IPython_,
   and allows IPython_ scripts to control Leo.

Sections 6, 7 and 8 are for programmers.  You may skip them if you like.

6. [Commanders, Nodes and Positions]

   In brief: Nothing in Leo is just text. All data in Leo is a true Python object.
   Leo's DOM (document object model) consists of **commanders**, **nodes** and **positions**.
   Saving a .leo files saves these objects.
   Leo's execute-script command predefines c, g and p:
   **c** is the outline's commander, **g** is Leo's utility module, leoGlobals.py,
   and **p** is the position of the presently selected node.
   c.allNodes_iter is an iterator returning all nodes of the outline.
   **p.h**, **p.b** and **p.u** are the headline, body text and user data of the node at position p.
   Internally, Leo represents nodes using two separate data structures,
   the **vnode** p.v and the **tnode** p.v.t.
   A position represents a state of a tree traversal:
   a node may appear at many distinct positions in an outline.

7. [Script Buttons and Node Types]

   In brief: Scripts can create new minibuffer commands, with key bindings.
   **Script buttons** bring scripts to data.
   Headlines can be considered **metadata** describing the body text.
   By convention, headlines starting with '@' specify types.
   *Leo scripts give meaning to types*.
   For example, the run-unit-tests-locally command converts the body of @test nodes
   into an instance of ``unittest.TestCase`` and runs that test case.

8. [Directives and Sections]

   In brief:  **Leo directives** specify properties of a node and its descendants.
   Directives may be inherited or overridden in descendant nodes.
   Leo can *generate* scripts by traversing (a part of) an outline!
   The @others directive tells where to place the expansion of **unnamed** child nodes
   in the generated script.
   **Section references** of the form ``&lt;&lt;section name&gt;&gt;`` tell where to place **named** child nodes.
   All parts of Leo generate scripts automatically as required.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090219090426.1">A **clone** is a "live" copy of a node that changes when the original nodes changes.
A small red arrow in icon boxes marks clones.
When you clone a node, there is no distinction between the "original" node and the "new" cloned node.
All clones are created equal; both nodes are now clones.
When you remove the penultimate cloned node, the last clone becomes a non-cloned node.

In effect, **all clones are the same node**.
When you change *any* part of cloned node,
Leo instantly updates the corresponding parts of all its clones,
including their headline, body text **and all their descendant nodes**.
Inserting, deleting or reordering child nodes in one clone,
causes Leo to make the corresponding changes in the children of all other clones.

If you have already installed Leo, now would be a good time to play with clones.
Start with a single node whose headline is A.
Clone this node using the clone-node (Ctrl-\`) command.
Type some text into the body of either node A. The same text appears in the
body of the other clone. Insert a node whose headline is B as a child of any clone.
All the A nodes now have a B child.
What happens when you clone B? All A nodes should now have *two* children B.
What happens when you insert, delete or move nodes that are children of A?
The corresponding changes should appear in all clones.
Verify that when the second-to-last cloned node is deleted the last cloned node
becomes a regular node again.

Using clones, any node may appear in many places in the outline.
A **view** is just a node containing other nodes.
**You can create as many views of your data as you want**,
each tailored exactly to the task at hand.
You never have to create a single "right" or "best" view.
You can have them all.
Views, being nodes, persist until you delete them.
**Leo is the best possible filing cabinet for any kind of data.**

To create a new view of the data, just create any *ordinary* node.
This **view node** represents the new view.
Views can contain any other nodes, but views typically contain one or more clones.
Views **gather** nodes from all parts of the outline.
**Views create a focus of attention**.

For example, when I begin to fix a bug I first create a view node for that bug.
I create a child node that contains the original bug report,
and possibly other child nodes containing notes and documentation, test results, etc.
Next, I go looking throughout Leo's code for nodes related to the bug.
When I find such a node I clone it and move one of the clones so it becomes a child of the view node.
Once I have created the view of the bug, I can concentrate *only* on that view.
Because all clones are, in effect, the *same* node,
I can fix code *elsewhere* by changing cloned nodes in the view.
In effect, I can limit my attention to just a few nodes.
**Views create mini-projects within a larger project**.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090219090426.2">This page tell how to turn (parts of) an outline into the text files,
so you can use Leo to create computer programs or other text documents,
including html and xml documents.

Leo can automatically generate text files from parts of an outline.
A single .leo file can generate many separate text files.
Headlines such as the following tell Leo to read and write the corresponding
**external file** when reading or writing the Leo outline::

    @auto &lt;filename&gt;
    @file &lt;filename&gt;
    @shadow &lt;filename&gt;
    @thin &lt;filename&gt;

Collectively, these **headline directives** are known as **@&lt;file&gt;** directives.
Leo has several more varieties of @&lt;file&gt; directives not listed above, but
we won't discuss them in this tutorial.

The @file and @thin directives **create** external files.
You could say that the Leo outline "owns" those files.
Leo inserts **sentinel comments** in files created with @file and @thin.
This allows Leo to store information that makes managing the files
easier, and allows @file and @thin outlines to have features that are 
not possible with @auto and @shadow.

The @auto and @shadow directives manage **imported** external files.
When reading an .leo file, Leo **parses** @auto and @shadow files.
When writing @auto and @shadow files, Leo writes those files **without sentinels**.
Thus, you can use @auto and @shadow to manage files owned by others.

To be revised...
-------------------------

Each file that is
to be created has a sub=outline headed by one of the @&lt;file&gt;
directives that specifies the filename to be created/updated.  The sub-
outline of the @&lt;file&gt; containing headline is the source of all the
text that will end up in the file, but just how is the hierarchically
organized text converted into a linear one?  To convey this process,
lets use a mechanical analogy of assembling a paper based 'scroll' of
the file's text.

First, you should be aware that headlines are not part of the
information that matters to whatever program is going to deal with the
output file, so they are not put in the relevant text of the output,
(they may end up in comments, but that is covered below).  For this
assembly process, headlines only possible use is as labels that name
the text that will be used to replace that labels occurence in the
bodytext of one of its parents.  Such labels are denoted by being
quoted by double angles, e.g. &lt;&lt;label&gt;&gt;, when these occur in bodytext,
they indicate the place at which their defining text is to be pasted,
when they occur in a headline, the indicate that that nodes bodytext
is to be used as the 'boilerplate text' for the replacement of any
occurrence of the label in one of its parents.  Any headline that is
not a 'label' exists strictly to flesh out the division of the
outline.

Thus far, the only text that will get picked up is the bodytext of the
@&lt;file&gt; node, with any &lt;&lt;labels&gt;&gt; it contains replaced with the
bodytext of the first child node that defines that label.  Any label
definition can extend this by having labels in its bodytext that is
then defined in one of its child nodes.  There is another mechanism to
indicate that child node's text is to be pick up and placed in the
output file, that is the occurrence of the directive "@others" in
either the initial @&lt;file&gt; node or the definition of a used
&lt;&lt;label&gt;&gt;.  The '@others' directive signals that the bodytext of all
the non label-defining children is to be picked up and pasted in its
place.

A note about the pasting in of text, whenever a &lt;&lt;label&gt;&gt; or and
@others is replace with the called for text, it is done in a way that
preserves the leading space that existed where the &lt;&lt;labe&gt;&gt; or @others
was</t>

This page discusses opening and editing non-Leo files, and settings.

Opening non-Leo files
=====================

To open and edit a non-Leo (non-.leo) file, select the file with the
``File:Open`` command as with any other editor. When you do this, Leo will
create an @edit node whose body text is the entire text of the file. These @edit
nodes are much like Emacs or vim buffers, but Leo will automatically load the
buffers whenever it loads the .leo file containing these nodes.

Rather than using the ``File:Open`` menu, you can create an @edit node yourself.
The headline is @edit ``&lt;filename&gt;`` where &lt;filename&gt; can be either an relative
or absolute path to the file in question. See the documentation for `@path`_ for
how relative paths are resolved.

**Important**: Leo contains a safeguard against inadvertently overriding files
when using @edit nodes. Leo will not write an @edit node if it contains an
**insignificant** amount of information: that is, if the @edit node contains
less than 10 lines of text and has no children. Thus, you can create an empty
@edit node affecting the corresponding file. The next time you open the .leo
file containing the @edit node, Leo will read the file into the node.

An introduction to Leo settings
===============================

Leo stores options in **@settings trees**, outlines whose headline is @settings.
When opening a .leo file, Leo looks for @settings trees not only in the outline
being opened but also in various leoSettings.leo files. This scheme allows for
great flexibility. The following is a *simplified* introduction. For more
information about settings, see: `Chapter 8: Configuring Leo`_ or Leo's main
configuration file, leo/config/leoSettings.leo.

Leo looks for @settings trees in the following places (among others):

1. The file leo/config/leoSettings.leo
2. The file ~/.leo/myLeoSettings.leo
3. The .leo file being loaded

Settings appearing later in the list override setting appearing earlier in the
list. Thus, leoSettings.leo contains defaults, myLeoSettings.leo contains
personal overrides, and settings in the.leo files being loaded override all
other settings.

Overriding of settings happens happens on a setting-by-setting basis, not on a
file-by-file basis. In other words, each individual setting overrides only the
corresponding setting in previously-read files. Reading a setting file does
**not** reset all previous settings.

Within an @settings tree, **settings nodes** such @bool, @int and @string nodes
specify various kinds of settings. For most settings nodes, the headline
specifies the setting, the body text contains explanatory comments. For other
settings nodes, the body text of the settings nodes specifies the setting.

With this brief introduction, you should be able to understand the contents of
leo/config/leoSettings.leo. This file contains extensive notes throughout. If
you want to change the defaults in leoSettings.leo, it is best to put your
changes in your myLeoSettings.leo file. That way your changes won't change when
you install a later version of Leo.</t>

This page discusses the rst3 and ipython plugins.

The rst3 plugin
===============

The rst3 plugin creates formatted output files from Leo outlines containing
reStructuredText_ (rST) a text markup language. For full information about this
plugin, see `Chapter 14`_.

With the rst3 plugin, you can organize book-length restructured text input using
outlines. Indeed, all of Leo's users guide was created using the rst3 plugin.
Besides the natural organization qualities of Leo's outlines, the rst3 plugin
provides two other important features:

1. The rst3 plugin will generate the chapter, section, subsection, etc. headings
   automatically based on headlines. There is no need to create reStructuredText
   headings by hand. This is a major convenience: the rst3 plugin will recompute
   markup for headings as you reorganize nodes.

2. You can specify **rst3 options** on a node-by-node basis. These options
   control how text is formatted. For example, you can choose to ignore or honor
   Leo directives, or to treat rST text as code or normal documentation.

The ipython plugin
===================

Leo's ipython plugin provides two-way communication (a bridge) between Leo and
IPython_: you can run Leo scripts from IPython, and IPython scripts from Leo.
For full details of this plugin, see `Chapter 21`_.

To use this plugin, you must `run Leo in a console window`_. When this plugin is
enabled, Leo's start-ipython command starts IPython in this console.

**You can run any IPython_ script from Leo**. Within Leo, the statement::

    ip = IPython.ipapi.get()

assigns ip to the _ip variable within IPython_. The ip variable allows scripts
running in Leo to do anything that an IPython_ script can do.

**You can run any Leo script from IPython_**. When the ipython plugin is
running, IPython_ scripts access Leo's c and g objects as follows::

    c,g = _leo.c, _leo.g

As usual, the c and g variables allow IPython_ scripts to do anything that a Leo
script can do.</t>

&gt; As I said, all I need would be is for leo to call callback/hook with
&gt; signature like
&gt; def complete(line-up-to-cursor, current_node) =&gt; list of strings

The actual signature is:

theObject,completionList = getExternalCompletions (self,s,p=None,language='python')

p is used only to get the language, or you can set the language by hand.

The setting is called -c or --config.  The one-config-file arg no longer exists.

http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/f3f95d93bcd93b94

Personally, I'd like to see another config file available via -c on
the command line:
(a common idiom)

leo myproject.leo -c /usr/lib/myproject/myLeoSettings.leo

or better yet:

leo myproject.leo -c /etc/leo/style01.leo
leo myotherproject.leo -c /etc/leo/style02.leo
leo anotherproject.leo -c /etc/leo/style23.leo

Each file opens in an editor with the shortcuts, buttons, commands,
plugins, appearance etc.  that has been tuned for that data management task.

or best yet:

leo myproject.leo -c /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/leo/config/style94.leo

==================

http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/b5a736089079acaf#

Please, I think each file has a distinct and required role.

- config/leoSettings.leo = Edward's base, required for a sane starting point

- home/.leo/myLeoSettings.leo = adjust Edwards suggestions to taste

- cwd/myLeoSettings.leo = provide a customized working environment in
this folder

- leo -c /usr/lib/leo-editor/src/config/zope3_ide.leo =
  - open this file in a specialized environments, mine or community contributed
  - ...

- currentfile/@settings =
  - I'm working on some customization ideas

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090324145450.23">- Leo opens a default .leo file if no other is specified, using the @string
  default_leo_file setting. The default for this setting is
  ``~/.leo/workbook.leo``

- Added escapes for underindented lines. The escape is specified by the @string
  underindent-escape-string setting. By default, this escape is ``\-`` If a line
  starts with \-N, Leo will write the line with N fewer spaces than expected.

- Leo now warns when attempting to write a file that has been changed outside of
  Leo. This prevents bzr reversions.

- Leo tests syntax of .py files when saving them.

- Leo can now open any file into an @edit node. This allows Leo to be associated
  with the edit action of .py files. Like this::

    C:\Python26\python.exe "c:\leo.repo\trunk\launchLeo.py" --gui=qt %1 %2

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090324145450.27">- Added autoCompleter.getExternalCompletions.
  See http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/4ad91984a6d0acac

- Added g.posList.

- c.config.doEnabledPlugins sets g.app.config.enabledPluginsFileName

- Added the following properties:
    - p.b, t.b and v.b return the body string of the position or node.
    - p.h, t.h and v.h return the head string of the position or node.
    - t.u and v.u return the uA of the node.
    - p.gnx, t.gnx and v.gnx return the gnx of the position or node.

- Added script to leoSettings.leo to ensure all menu items are valid.

- c.config.getSettingSource(setting_name)
  returns the name of the file which Leo used to determine the setting:

    - D indicates default settings.
    - F indicates the file being loaded
    - L indicates leoSettings.leo
    - M indicates myLeoSettings.leo

- Predefined 'self' in @test/@suite nodes.

- Added c.getNodePath and c.getNodeFileName.
  See http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/3b5f1232ecc6bba7
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090324145450.36">- The --config command-line option specifies a single config (.leo) file
  to use for configuration.
  See http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/f3f95d93bcd93b94

- The --file=fileName command-line option load a file.
  Only .zip and .leo extensions are allowed at present.

- The --gui=name command-line option specifies the gui to use.
  The valid values are --gui=qt, --gui=tk
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090324145450.40">- Added smart home (back-to-home) command.

- Added support for standard behavior of Tab and Shift-Tab keys.
  The tab key indents the text selection, if there is one;
  otherwise, the tab key insert a tab or blanks, depending on the @tabwidth setting.
  Shift-Tab always unindents one or more lines.

- The open command creates @edit nodes when opening non-.leo files
  The open file dialog now shows all files by default.
  Selecting a non-.leo file will load that file into a new node in the present outline.

- Added added pdb minibuffer command.
  This works, but stops Leo in the middle of the command-handling logic.
  You may get the commander c by stepping out into
  k.masterKeyHandler or k.masterCommandHandler.
  Using c, you can then get all other info.

- Improved the isearch commands.

- find-clone-all is a synonym for clone-find-all.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090324145450.46">- Added @nocolor-node directive.

- Improved @path handling.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090324145450.49">- @string default_leo_file = ~/.leo/workbook.leo

- @string underindent-escape-string = \-

- @int icon_bar_widgets_per_row

- Added support for meta keys.
  http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/b6a39ed672a28c65?pli=1

- The qt gui is now the default.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090324145450.54">- Improved nav_buttons plugin and corresponding nodeHistory class.

- Created qtGui and tkGui plugins.

- Created leoGuiPluginsRef.leo.

Leo 4.6 b2 is now available at:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3458&amp;package_id=29106

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.6:
--------------------------

- Cached external files *greatly* reduces the time to load .leo files.
- Leo now features a modern Qt interface by default.
  Leo's legacy Tk interface can also be used.
- New --config, --file and --gui command-line options.
- Leo tests syntax of .py files when saving them.
- Leo can now open any kind of file into @edit nodes.
- @auto-rst nodes support "round-tripping" of reStructuredText files.
- Properties of commanders, positions and nodes simplify programming.
- Improved Leo's unit testing framework.
- Leo now requires Python 2.4 or later.
- Dozens of small improvements and bug fixes.

The expected/customary behaviour (one you get used to in almost every editor) is:

End: always move to end of line
Home: Move to first visible chararacter on the line. When pressing home again, move to column zero. If Home is pressed one more time, move to first visible character again.

This is also the way emacs behaves, though ctrl+a always moves to column zero.</t>

I have 'dabbrev-expands' bound to the F4 key. When I press F4 after
the word "freq" in a body pane containing the word "frequency" then
Leo 4.5.1 shows a hour-glass for a while before giving an empty
dabbrev-expand: prompt in the minibuffer.

If I back up one character, putting point between the e and q and then
type F4, I get the expected behavior: the word "frequency" is inserted
immediately.

What I did:

- Removed "not ready messages".
- Made the code undoable.
- Added wimpy unit test.</t>

With a long body text you might place the cursor on a line, hold down Shift, and
PgDn several pages to select a large block of text. The last PgDn may overshoot
the range you want selected, so you should be able to use UpArrow to bring the
bottom of the range back up to where you want it. However, on the first UpArrow
the selection is lost and restarted from the current cursor position. I.e. you
end up with just one line selected, instead of trimming one line of the
selection of several pages, as intended.

- leoTest.runUnitTestLeoFile runs all unit tests in a given .leo file

- leoTest.runTestsExternally calls runUnitTestLeoFile after creating
  dynamicUnitTest.leo.

- When reporting that no unit tests were found, all unit tests commands tell

<t tx="ekr.20090620073906.12095">- leoDynamicTest.py now supports a --path argument giving the .leo file.
  This is so useful!

- leoDynamicTest.py now honors the --silent argument.

- leoTest.runUnitTestLeoFile runs all unit tests in a given .leo file
  in a separate process.

- leoTest.runTestsExternally calls runUnitTestLeoFile after creating
  dynamicUnitTest.leo.

- When reporting that no unit tests were found, all unit tests commands tell
  whether the entire outline or just the selected outline was searched.
  This fixes sometimes-misleading error messages.

- test.leo contains a 'run-test.leo-tests' button.

- leoPy.leo contains a 'run-all-core-tests' button.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090620082840.5608">Added support for @auto-rst nodes. These import reStructuredText (rST) files
so that the files can be "round-tripped" without introducing extraneous changes.
This makes Leo a superb environment for using rST.
