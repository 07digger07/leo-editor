@language rest
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/leo-editor/Wd0NtBLEZZk

What I did:

- Added v.expandedPositions ivar.
- Wrote c.shouldBeExpanded.
- p.isExpanded calls c.shouldBeExpanded if p is a clone.
  This is important: it means that most code does not have to be aware of c.shouldBeExpanded.
- p.expand & p.contract maintain p.v.expandedPositions list.
- Rewrote & simplified p.isVisible.
- Left c.positionExists and p.isAncestorOf unchanged.
.. @+node:ekr.20131222112420.16373: *4* Notes
The idea is store "ephemeral" or position-related data **in vnodes*. This
is a completely new idea in Leo's history!

Suppose every vnode contains a new ivar: v.expandedPositions, a list of
(copies of) positions at which v is to be expanded. This would work as
follows:

1. Contracting a node at position p clears p.v.expandedPositions. The happy
   side effects is that contracting any clone will contract them all.

2. Expanding a node at position appends p.copy() to p.v.expandedPositions,
   and purges any no-longer-existing positions from that list.

3. nativeTree.drawChildren will expand nodes using c.shouldBeExpanded(p) instead of
   p.isExpanded(p).

As always, changing outline structure will invalidate positions. Because
c.p and all it's ancestors are always expanded, the worst that can happen
when an outline changes is that some positions that *aren't* the present
position will contract unexpectedly. Most such contraction will occur off
screen.
.. @+node:ekr.20131223064351.16352: *3* Improved p.isAncestorOf and c.positionExists
- Added test for c.positionExists to p.isAncestorOf.
- Added v.isNthChildOf
- Rewrote c.positionsExists using v.isNthChildOf
.. @+node:ekr.20131224124822.16717: *3* Fixed problems with clone-expansion
@language rest

Alt-End when the last top-level node was a clone caused all clones to expand.

The fix was in p.isAncestorOf.

Also, changed p.all_unique_positions() to p.all_positions() in places where p.contract was called.

I started this project by doing a clone-find-all for isExpanded.

I selected ALL nodes, and deleted them. (I think I used the context menu
delete) Then the outline window was red, could not insert any nodes, could
not Undo. Todd. Had to abandon the outline and start again.

@language rest

This runs pylint (with optional Sherlock tracing) in
a separate process, thereby allowing Leo to run
pylint unchanged.

What I did:

1. pylint-leo.py: run now runs the following command in a separate process::

    <python> -c "import leo.core.leoGlobals as g; g.run_pylint(<args>)"
    
2. g.run_pylint uses Sherlock tracing if requested.

    
.. @+node:ekr.20140424102007.16873: *3* Fixed clone-find-all command
Changed find.findAll and helpers as follows:
    
- findAll inits onlyPosition for the clone-find-all commands.
    
- createCloneFindAllNode does not link the node into the outline.
  To do this, leoFind.py imports leo.core.leoNodes.

- linkCloneFindAllNode does this *after* the command completes. This keeps
  all positions unchanged while they are being scanned.
   
- The code now tests for either clone_find_all or clone_find_all_flattened
  in various places.

@language rest

Reinhard Engel reinhard.engel.de@googlemail.com

There seems to be a subtle bug in leoGlobals.py:

In the 'globalDirectiveList', the directive 'command' is missing. This
seems not to cause problems, because of the way 'aList' in
'compute_directives_re' is constructed. Then in 'get_directives_dict' the
directive is silently skipped.

The following pattern in 'compute_directives_re' solves this problem:

@language python

aList = [x for x in globalDirectiveList if z != 'others']
aList.sort(lambda a,b: len(b)-len(a))
    # Sort by length, longest first
pat = "^@(%s)(?=( |\t|\n)+)" % "|".join(aList)

These commands now get their arguments from the Find Panel.

Changed the following methods:

generalChangeHelper,
minibufferFind/ReplaceAll,
searchWithPresentOptions,
setReplaceString,

Also fixed the bindings in create_find_buttons so buttons
are bound to the proper button-related methods. As a result,
the find-all and change-all buttons now work as expected.
