Leo deserves good friendly printing features which anyone can use. At the moment we have a confusing patchwork of choices. Printing Leo seems to be both harder and easier than  first meets the eye.

print-to-web (htmlize) should definitely be on Leo's missing PRINT MENU.

Having a little library of export scripts--well named, documented and intended to aid printing woudl go a long way. Thesse scripts anyone coiuld be called by onayone given a Leo Outline, accessing a navabr button. PRINT MENU or list. Or they can just insert the appropriate script  into an outline giving finer grained print control on the fly.
