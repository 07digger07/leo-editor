New colorizing code doesn't update properly after changing @language directives. 
.. @+node:ekr.20170131035450.1: ** re #387: New file is marked as changed
https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/387

The problem:

abbrev.init_tree_abbrev changes the outline's changed indicator (*) during startup.
Simply reversing this in c.new causes the * to flip back and forth.

The changes were a bit tricky:
    
- init_tree_abbrev calls c.pasteOutline(...,redrawFlag=False)
- pasteOutline calls c.setChanged(True, redrawFlag=redrawFlag)
- c.new calls c.setChanged(False)
- Added redrawFlag keyword arg to c.setChanged.
  When this is false, c.setChanged does not alter the outline's changed indicator.
  
Suppressing the change indicator is a bit dangerous.
It could be very confusing if the indicator gets out of sync with reality.
But the fix should actually be safe enough, because only startup code is affected.
