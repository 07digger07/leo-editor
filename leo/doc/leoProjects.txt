https://bugs.launchpad.net/leo-editor/+bug/1158269
viewrendered pane goes blank when url clicked.

Clicking on a url link in a viewrendered pane causes the viewrendered pane
to completely blank. The action successfully launches a browser. Then if I
clear the viewrendered pane (right-click, Remove 1 Right) and repeat the
alt-x vr command, a detached blank python window is launched. The only way
to get the viewrendered panel to be embedded in leo is to restart.

Binding to Ctrl-. does not work on the Mac::

    delete-node = Ctrl-.
    
Worse, this standard key binding does not work on the Mac::

    clone-node = Ctrl-`
    
There is no obvious way to fix these problems: Leo never gets a key event.
Presumably MacOS handles these keys before passing them to Leo.

The workaround is to pick other bindings.  For example::

    delete-node = Ctrl-,
