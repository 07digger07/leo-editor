https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/leo-editor/X9rePlT6Meg

In Python 3 there is no 'unicode' function.

- A big collapse in complexity in g.reportBadChars.
- Added an important guard in g.ue for Python 3.

The plugin tries to create a new file inside the install path, and doesn't
have the permission.

Is there a way to configure the path of this spellpyx.txt to, say, $HOME/.leo?

@language rest

https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/78

The problem was in the PythonQSyntaxHighlighter class: it does not work
*exactly* like QSyntaxHighlighter. The fix was to call w.seeInsertPoint()
in pqsh.reformat_blocks_helper.

The fix now involves the g.app.all_delayed_see switch.

Here is how to demonstrate the bug:

- Open leoPy.leo
- select @file ../external/PythonTidy.py
- search for print (whole word)
- The first match shows properly (it doesn't scroll).
- The second match does *not* scroll properly.

This was a side effect of fixing https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/78

Added g.app.allow_see and related logic.

.. @+node:ekr.20150206064817.13: *4* Leo must have sentinels, even without clones
Sentinels are necessary for clones, but sentinels would
still be necessary if clones did not exist.

Sentinels create **identity**, the notion that a particular
nodes starts at *this* place in the external file and
extends to *this other* place. Identity is a persistent,
invariant attribute of a file: Leo recreates all the nodes
of the external files when re-reading the file.

It's really that simple, but here are some consequences:

1. Identity remains even when the contents of a node
   changes. Thus, there is *no way* to use content-related
   mechanisms to recreate identity. This means, for example,
   that git can never help recover identity.

2. Leo's sentinels mark an *arbitrary* range of text within
   the external file. Thus, @auto files can never be as
   flexible as @file nodes.

.. @+node:ekr.20150206064817.5: *3* Major feature: @nosent updates automatically
Rev 7a851eb enables automatic updating of @nosent files.
When loading a .leo file, Leo will automatically update
@nosent trees if the corresponding external file has been
changed outside Leo! This is one of the most important
advances in Leo's history.

As discussed yesterday, using @nosent files is about twice
as fast as using @shadow trees. No shadow directories or
shadow files are needed: it's trivial to recreate the
"shadow" data from the @nosent tree!

Why, of why, did we never see this before? It could have
been done at any time since Leo supported @shadow.

Finally, Leo reports all changes using the "recovered nodes"
mechanism. No new code was required: the core @shadow code
was not changed in any way.

at.readOneAtNosentNode and two simple helpers handle
all the details. readOneAtNosentNode uses the @shadow
algorithm to compute the updated lines of the @nosent tree,
exactly as described yesterday. If the new lines match the
old, nothing more need be done: we can use the existing
@nosent tree as is. Otherwise, the new lines are passed to
at.readOpenFile to delete the old tree and create the
@nosent tree. This part of the code is similar to the code
in at.read, but it is much simpler because caching is not
involved. In essence, everything "just worked" from the get
go.
