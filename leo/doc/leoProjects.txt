https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/180

Terry:
I suspect this is not really a bookmark specific problem. Rather, the point in code execution where visited positions are recorded for goto-prev-history-node is too "high", so that a lot of things which change the selected node are missed by it.

What is the definition of visiting a node? It could be giving focus to the body editor, but that would be confusing, so it seems it should be having the tree drawn with a node selected counts as visiting the node.

#264: Solution to #261 needs improvement
https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/264

If you go from the initial layout to a custom layout and then back to "Default", you get a layout the *looks* like the default, but has no splitter 'splitter_2'. The splitters are unnamed.

So rather than searching for the splitter called splitter_2, you'd need to search for the splitter containing the two panes usually separated by splitter 2.

The problem was an apparent reversion. VimEvent's now need a "c" ivar.

Leo's keyboard events doesn't work after "Insert" on headline and Alt+Tab Alt+Tab.
https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/270

Strange behavior when I leave Leo (Alt+Tab) after "Insert" on headline node.

When I come back (Alt+Tab) to Leo only the menu works (Alt+F, ...) and the mouse.

Other unusual behavior:
left-arrow, right-arrow changes between Leo documents (like Ctrl+Tab in normal behavior)
