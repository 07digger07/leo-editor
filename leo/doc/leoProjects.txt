@language rest
  
- pd.update_before_write_foreign_file tells when an @data node has been
  changed. This explains why the .leo file is now dirty.
- at.saveOutlineIfPossible automatically saves the .leo file if only
  unchanged persistence nodes remain.
  
at.saveOutlineIfPossible makes the following hacks unnecessary:
    
- at.writeAllHelper writes an unchanged @auto file only if it is
  selected explicitly.
- Changed at.writeAll so that the no @<file> node written message now says
  that you must selected an unchanged @auto node directly in order to write
  it with the write-at-files-nodes command.

When the find tab is selected in the log pane, Alt-X complements the Regexp

@language rest

Reinhard Engel reinhard.engel.de@googlemail.com

There seems to be a subtle bug in leoGlobals.py:

In the 'globalDirectiveList', the directive 'command' is missing. This
seems not to cause problems, because of the way 'aList' in
'compute_directives_re' is constructed. Then in 'get_directives_dict' the
directive is silently skipped.

The following pattern in 'compute_directives_re' solves this problem:

@language python

aList = [x for x in globalDirectiveList if z != 'others']
aList.sort(lambda a,b: len(b)-len(a))

By: djsg  David

Let's say that I log on as David to Windows 2000 or Windows XP and install
Leo 4.3. You then log out. You log in as Edward, and click Start, pick
Programs... you have no visible entry for Leo!

The above scenario works for me.

Let's say that I log on as David to Windows 2000 or Windows XP and install
Leo 4.3. You then log out. You log in as Edward, and click Start, pick
Programs... you have no visible entry for Leo!

The current Setup routine allows no one but David to use Leo on this computer.
To make things worse, when I go to use Leo, I have to log in to Windows using
the account under which I installed it, which has Administrator rights to the
computer. In other words, I can't use Leo without operating the computer in
a mode that leaves it needlessly vulnerable to security violations.

===== Proposal (won't do)

Setup should ask whether to install Leo for everyone or for the installer's
account only.

If the answer to that question is "yes," Setup should give the user a
private copy of everything that comes with Leo -- the only application
shared should be the current Python, assuming that it is installed for all
users.

http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3064212
By: djsg  David 

LeoSetup allows only one copy of Leo on a given computer. 

LeoSetup assumes that you want Leo in C:\Program Files\Leo. The installer can
override that already. LeoSetup also goes to some trouble to set up the usual
click-to-open behavior for .leo files. That behavior is tied to the copy of
Python that was current when I ran LeoSetup, and tied to the copy of Leo that
was installed most recently.

===== Proposal

When LeoSetup finds Python installed for that single user, it should ask
whether to install Leo for the installer's account only. If the answer to
that question is "yes," Setup should give the user a private copy of
everything that comes with Leo and use the single-user installation of
Python.

This matters because if you need to test your plug-ins with different
versions of Python, this would make that easier.

LeoSetup does not run without human intervention. This complicates
deploying Leo in multi-computer sites.

The message box that displays the path of the Python installation found is one
issue. I put it in to allow the installer to cross-check Setup's behavior. Since
nobody has complained about problems with the code I wrote to fix the problem
installing with Python 2.4 and Active Python, Setup need no longer force the
installer to review the message box's contents.

===== Proposal: The message box needs to time out after, say, 15 seconds.

.. @+node:ekr.20141028061518.8: *4* Fixed bug 74: problems with @button if defined in myLeoSettings.leo
@language rest

https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/74

What I did:

- ScriptingController now uses *gnxs* (not vnodes!) to detect duplicate buttons.
- Use AtButtonCallback for *all* buttons.
- QtIconBarClass.setCommandForButton always calls
  ScriptingController.build_rclick_tree.
- build_rclick_tree no longer assumes that command_p exists.

Rev 8413e2d fixes an important bug in the new code: "remote"
buttons (buttons defined in settings files) now work if the
settings file is not open.

There are some tricky details that must be handled. As an
example, consider a button defined as follows in
myLeoSettings.leo:

    @button print p.h
    print(p.h)

Detail 1: Leo must open myLeoSettings.leo to find the
@button node. Unlike the Goto Script rclick item, the search
does *not* leave myLeoSettings.leo open. That would be too
great a side effect of clicking the @button node!

Detail 2: We don't want to open myLeoSettings.leo every time
the user clicks the buttons, so the first time the user does
so the script is saved (cached). If the user clicks the
button later the cached value is used.

Detail 3: Caching is used "forever" (while Leo remains
open), even if the user opens myLeoSettings.leo and changes
the script. Sorry, this can't be helped. Don't ask me to
change this.

Detail 4: The new code is careful to execute the script in
the commander in which the button is *located*, not in the
commander in which the button is defined.

Report:

Putting @button definitions in myLeoSettings.leo (in an @buttons tree)
makes them available in all Leo files, a nice feature. Two problems:

- The buttons lack the 'Goto Script' rclick feature in all .leo files.
- There are duplicate buttons in myLeoSettings.leo

.. @+node:ekr.20140825071827.18528: *4* Created g.IdleTime and qtGui.IdleTime
@language rest

Rev 060c33a...Leo build: 20140825070951 contains a spectacular collapse in
complexity in idle-time handling. Instantly, registering idle-time event
handlers can be considered deprecated, though I have no plans to remove the
horrendous older code.

The new pattern allows multiple, independent (or cooperating) idle-time
handlers, created at will as needed.

The new code is based on the IdleTime class in qtGui.py. Rather than access
this directly, code should use the g.IdleTime proxy:: g.IdleTime ensures
that all is well when using gui's that don't have an IdleTime class.

Here is how to use the new code::

    def handler(it):
        '''The IdleTime handler: called at idle time.'''
        delta_t = it.time-it.starting_time
        g.trace(it.count,it.c.shortFileName(),'%2.4f' % (delta_t))
        if it.count >= 5:
            g.trace('done')
            it.stop()
    it = g.IdleTime(c,handler,delay=500)
    if it: it.start()

The code creates an instance of the IdleTime class that calls the given handler at idle time, and no more than once every 500 msec.  Here is the output::

    handler 1 ekr.leo 0.5100
    handler 2 ekr.leo 1.0300
    handler 3 ekr.leo 1.5400
    handler 4 ekr.leo 2.0500
    handler 5 ekr.leo 2.5610
    handler done

Timer instances are completely independent.  For example:

    def handler1(it):
        '''The IdleTime handler: called at idle time.'''
        delta_t = it.time-it.starting_time
        g.trace('%2s %s %2.4f' % (it.count,it.c.shortFileName(),delta_t))
        if it.count >= 5:
            g.trace('done')
            it.stop()

    def handler2(it):
        '''The IdleTime handler: called at idle time.'''
        delta_t = it.time-it.starting_time
        g.trace('%2s %s %2.4f' % (it.count,it.c.shortFileName(),delta_t))
        if it.count >= 10:
            g.trace('done')
            it.stop()

    it1 = g.IdleTime(c,handler1,delay=500)
    it2 = g.IdleTime(c,handler2,delay=1000)
    if it1 and it2:
        it1.start()
        it2.start()

Here is the output::

    handler1  1 ekr.leo 0.5200
    handler2  1 ekr.leo 1.0100
    handler1  2 ekr.leo 1.0300

@nocolor-node

0. Added details timing traces throughout the selectHelper logic.
   These traces showed precisely where the performance bugs were.

1. updateSyntaxColorer now does nothing if the body text starts with @killcolor.

2. w.setSelectionRangeHelper and v.restoreCursorAndScroll had performance bugs
because they called code that computed the length of text slowly.

3. The solution: w.setSelectionRangeHelper and all setInsertPoint methods
now take an 's' keyword arg. In the selection logic, s is set to p.b.
If s is not None, the desired length is simply len(s)

As a result, w.setSelectionRangeHelper no longer calls lengthHelper.
lengthHelper used QTextCursor, which is *much* slower than getAllText.

4. Even though all w.setInsertPoint methods have an s keyword arg,
   v.restoreCursorAndScroll uses the following defensive code::

        w.widget.setInsertPoint(ins,s=v._bodyString)

The idea is store "ephemeral" or position-related data **in vnodes*. This

Suppose every vnode contains a new ivar: v.expandedPositions, a list of
(copies of) positions at which v is to be expanded. This would work as
follows:

1. Contracting a node at position p clears p.v.expandedPositions. The happy
   side effects is that contracting any clone will contract them all.

2. Expanding a node at position appends p.copy() to p.v.expandedPositions,
   and purges any no-longer-existing positions from that list.

3. nativeTree.drawChildren will expand nodes using c.shouldBeExpanded(p) instead of
   p.isExpanded(p).

As always, changing outline structure will invalidate positions. Because
c.p and all it's ancestors are always expanded, the worst that can happen
when an outline changes is that some positions that *aren't* the present
position will contract unexpectedly. Most such contraction will occur off
screen.

@language rest

This runs pylint (with optional Sherlock tracing) in
a separate process, thereby allowing Leo to run
pylint unchanged.

What I did:

1. pylint-leo.py: run now runs the following command in a separate process::

    <python> -c "import leo.core.leoGlobals as g; g.run_pylint(<args>)"
    
2. g.run_pylint uses Sherlock tracing if requested.

These commands now get their arguments from the Find Panel.

Changed the following methods:

generalChangeHelper,
minibufferFind/ReplaceAll,
searchWithPresentOptions,
setReplaceString,

Also fixed the bindings in create_find_buttons so buttons
are bound to the proper button-related methods. As a result,
the find-all and change-all buttons now work as expected.
.. @+node:ekr.20140702091137.16754: *4* Improved idle-time handling and added new commands
@language rest

Added the following commands:
    
disable-idle-time-tracing
enable-idle-time-tracing
toggle-idle-time-tracing
disable-idle-time-events
enable-idle-time-events
toggle-idle-time-events

Simplified and generalized idle-time handling as follows:
    
- Removed g.app.afterHandler: g.app.idleTimeHook does the same thing now.
- The timer callback now calls g.app.idleTimeHook() if it exists.
- g.enableIdleTimeHook now has the following signature::
    
    def enableIdleTimeHook(idleTimeDelay=500,idleTimeHandler=None):
        
  The two args set g.app.idleTimeDelay and g.app.idleTimeHandler respectively.
  g.idleTimeHookHandler is used if idleTimeHandler is None.

The new code has these properties:
    
1. g.app.idleTimeHook() actually gets called only at idle-time,
2. There is no busy waiting, and
3. There is at least g.app.idleTimeDelay msec. between calls to g.app.idleTimeHook()

Here is an script illustrating the possibilities::

@language python

'''

.. @+node:ekr.20140402091953.16865: *4* Added pylint command
@language rest

When pylint is available on your machine, Leo's pylint
command will execute run pylint on all @<file> nodes in the
selected tree. This command is now available from the popup
menus created by the contextmenu plugin.

This command is a dynamic way of selecting files to check
with pylint. It is *much* easier to use than the old pylint
-r option in pylint-leo.py. There is no longer any need to
update a list of "recent" files. Hooray.

The command has significantly changed my work flow. I use
pylint much more often.

The details of the search process are as follows:

1. The command looks down the tree of the selected node,
   looking for @<file> nodes.
2. If now @<file> nodes are found, it looks up the tree,
   looking for @<file> nodes.
3. If the selected node is a clone, and no @<file> nodes
   have yet been found, it expands the search to all
   ancestors of all positions cloned to the selected node.

This means that you can check a file by selecting any
(possibly clone) node of the file.

**Important**: running pylint-leo.py is still often very
useful. In particular, I often run python pylint-leo.py -a
to check all files. Here is the recently improved docstring
for pylint-leo.py::

    '''
    This file runs pylint on predefined lists of files.
    
    The -r option no longer exists. Instead, use Leo's pylint command to run
    pylint on all Python @<file> nodes in a given tree.
    
    On windows, the following .bat file runs this file::
        python27 pylint-leo.py %*
    
    On Ubuntu, the following alias runs this file::
        pylint="python27 pylint-leo.py"

@language rest

What I did:
- at.createWritersData inits tables using the writers_dict in each plugin.
- at.writeOnAtAutoNode calls at.dispatch to find writers.
  An important escape hatch: at.writeOnAtAutoNode calls the *existing* rst.writer
  if the user deletes plugins/writers/rst.py.

Won't do:
- at.writeAllHelper has lots of special-case code, but that probably can't be helped.
- It would be way too dangerous to refactor the write code for @file, @shadow, etc.

.. @+node:ekr.20140729162415.18088: *4* Leo now supports dynamic @auto names
@language rest

The leo/plugins/importers folders now contains importer plugins.

The leo/plugins/writers folders now contain writer plugins.

Both importer and writer plugins can defined new kinds of @auto nodes.

Importers and writers can register either @auto-names or
file extensions. I have just verified that @auto x.xyzzy
will use both the importer and the writer for the .xyzzy
extension, that is, importers/test.py and writers/test.py.
So, for *unique* extensions, there is no need to use a
separate @auto name, you can just use @auto.

What I did:

- atFile.ctor sets two sets of spellings of @auto names: g.app.atAutoNames
  & g.app.atFileNames

- Loading importer & writer plugins updates g.app.atAutoNames:
    - at.parse_writer_dict sets at.atAutoWritersDict & at.writersDispatchDict
    - ic.parse_importer_dict sets ic.atAutoDict and ic.classDispatchDict

@language rest

This is a major upgrade to the beautify command.

PythonTidy (tidy for short) does a full parse of the Python sources: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PythonTidy/

What I did today.  See the << version info >> section for all the details::

1. Leonized tidy's sources: @file ../external/PythonTidy.py in in LeoPyRef.leo.

- Removed all pylint complaints and made other minor mods.
 
2. Suppressed features not appropriate for Leo:

- Adds shebang and encoding lines only for @<file> nodes.
- Suppress extra spacing between classes & functions.

3. Added settings to leoSettings.leo that control tidy operation:

    @bool tidy_add_blank_lines_around_comments =True
    @bool tidy_double_quoted_strings = False
    @bool tidy_keep_blank_lines = True
    @bool tidy_left_adjust_docstrings = False
    @int  tidy_lines_before_split_lit = 2
    @int  tidy_seps_before_split_line = 8

3. Fixed several important bugs:

- The original code deleted all comments because of a botch in Comments__init__.
- Tidy now properly handles the tidy_add_blank_lines_around_comments and tidy_double_quoted_strings settings.

This plugin used ancient coding technology, created menu

All these defects have now been remedied.  It could be quite useful in some situations.

For example, suppose node P has this body text::

    @produce echo pylint commands
    @produce pylint -v
    @produce pylint -f core\leoAtFile.py
    @produce pylint -g

Selected node P and running the at-produce-selected command produces these messages in the log pane::

    @produce pylint -g
    @produce pylint -g
    @produce pylint -g
    @produce pylint -g
    at-produce done

And produces a node whose headline is::

    produce.log from Sun Sep 21 06:35:37 2014

And whose body text is::
