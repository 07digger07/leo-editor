https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/386
All changes made to leo/modes/md.py
.. @+node:ekr.20170326054533.1: *4* Fixed bug in k.computeInverseBindingDict
The bug gave way too many bindings for the move-lines commands.
.. @+node:ekr.20170325085907.1: *3* code
.. @+node:ekr.20170325085939.1: *4* Added better checks in v.setBodyString & v.setHeadString
.. @+node:ekr.20170325090029.1: *3* features
.. @+node:ekr.20170325090032.1: *4* Added show-color-names command
.. @+node:ekr.20170326052408.1: *4* Improved move-lines-up/down commands
These commands (bound to ctrl-up/down by default) now work at the top or bottom of the body pane. The move-lines-up command inserts a new line below the moved line/lines when the lines are at the top of the body text.  Similarly, the move-lines-down command inserts a line before the moved lines when at the bottom of the body text. Imo, this is a natural and useful.
.. @+node:ekr.20170325045838.1: *4* #448: Add abbreviations for commands
@language rest
@wrap

https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/448

If the expansion of an abbrevitiation is a command name, that command will be executed. Alas, this isn't very useful: typing destroys selection ranges.

This took only a few lines of code in abbrev.expandAbbrev.
