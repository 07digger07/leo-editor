.. @+node:ekr.20150512102801.1: *4* Decorators simplify Leo's command dispatching
Please read carefully if you write plugins or are one of Leo's core developers.  Everyone else can safely ignore this post.

The present (g.new_dispatch) project simplifies Leo's code as follows:

1. Decorators will define all Leo commands.  All getPublicCommands methods will disappear, along with their association lists of command names and bound methods.

2. Leo will never call c.universalCallback.

I understand neither it's docstring, nor its code, nor why it is needed. Leo will be better off without it and the corresponding 'wrap' argument to k.registerCommand. This wrapper gives rise to wretched code::

    @g.command('cke-text-open')
    def cmd_OpenEditor(kwargs, at_rich=False):
        '''Open the rich text editor, hide the regular editor.'''
        c = kwargs['c'] if isinstance(kwargs, dict) else kwargs

Apparently, kwargs might be two different kinds of objects depending on who calls the function.  This kind of code must go.  In an emergency, code could add ivars/attributes to exiting events, but even that would be too complex by half.

3. The Plugin class in plugins_menu.py creates Leo commands for functions whose names start with ``cmd_``.  It took me hours yesterday to figure out that this was happening.

<< Look for additional commands >> creates yet another wrapper, with yet another signature. The wrapper now has a more conforming signature and a better name::

    def plugins_menu_wrapper(kwargs, cmd=cmd):
        return cmd(kwargs['c'])

This signature allows a unit test to pass even when plugins_menu_wrapper is not wrapped again.

Happily, all of this is going to go away. ``@g.command`` will define all commands in plugins. No more invisible ``cmd_`` naming convention.

4. class AtButtonCallback now supports the __name__ attribute using a new __getattr__ method. This allows k.registerCommand not to know about the AtButtonCallback wrapper.

5. The LeoKeyEvent class now has a get method.  Code can now call event.get('c') in all cases.  Probably ditto for kwargs.get('c').

**Summary**

The new_dispatch project simplifies some of the most complex code in Leo.  It is worth a week's work.

I followed three principles while simplifying the code:

1. Eliminate malignant if statements::

    c = kwargs['c'] if isinstance(kwargs, dict) else kwargs

proliferates implementation details from one part of Leo to another.  As a result, it becomes much harder to change code without side effects.  I have been dealing with such side effects all week.

2. Regularize interfaces.

- ``@cmd`` or ``@g.command`` decorators will define all Leo commands.
- The ``cmd_`` convention will disappear, along with the complex code that creates it.
- event.get('c') will work in any code decorated by ``@cmd`` or ``@g.command``.
- AtButtonCallback instances now have a __name__.

3. Regularize objects.

Changing the interface of an object by wrapping it is unacceptable. c.universalCallback must go.

@language rest
@wrap

- Defined all commands in leoPlugins.leo with @g.command.
- Eliminate the "cmd_" convention.
  The g.command decorator now sets func.is_command and func.command_name.
  Plugin.create_menu is now much simpler.
- All decorated commands now use the "event" arg:

    @g.command('command-name')
    def my_command(event=None):
        ...
    
    @cmd('command-name')
    def my_command(self,event=None):

jasonic

Leo deserves good friendly printing features which anyone can use. At the moment we have a confusing patchwork of choices. Printing Leo seems to be both harder and easier than  first meets the eye.

print-to-web (htmlize) should definitely be on Leo's missing PRINT MENU.

Having a little library of export scripts--well named, documented and intended to aid printing woudl go a long way. Thesse scripts anyone coiuld be called by onayone given a Leo Outline, accessing a navabr button. PRINT MENU or list. Or they can just insert the appropriate script  into an outline giving finer grained print control on the fly.

Useful for per-file backups.
.. @+node:ekr.20150425135844.1: *4* Added support for @data history-list
If you aren't using the @data history-list setting chances are that you missing a big chance to simplify your workflow. At one time I thought the history list was a minor feature.  I could not have been more wrong.

The body of the @data history-list node should contain a list of command names, one per line.  This list can include commands created by @command/@button nodes.

You execute items in the history list by doing Alt-X followed by an up arrow to get the first item in the list, or one or more down arrows to get later items in the list.  The last item you execute from this list goes to the head of the list.  Once you have executed an item, Ctrl-P (repeat complex command) will re-execute it.

The history list works well for commands that aren't quite worth a separate key binding, but that nevertheless you find you using quite often.

Even better, the history list is a perfect complement to @button and @command nodes that are tailored for a particular outline. For example, there is a button called cfa-code in leoPy.leo that executes the clone-find-all-flattened command starting at the top-level "Code" node.

Here are the details:

@ifenv name, one-or-more-comma-separated values
 
Includes descendant settings if os.getenv(name) matches any of the values.

- Case is significant in the *name* of the environment variable.
- Case is ignored in the *values*.

Examples:

@ifenv HOSTNAME,bob
    Enables descendant settings if os.environ('HOSTNAME') is 'Bob' or 'bob'
   
@ifenv EDITOR,leo,lion
    Enables descendant settings if os.environ('Editor') is 'Leo' or 'Lion', etc.

@ifplatform name,  one-or-more-comma-separated values.
  
Includes descendant settings if sys.platform matches any of the values, ignoring case.

Examples:

@ifplatform darwin,linux2
    Enables descendant settings for MacOS and Linux.

@ifplatform win32
    Enables descendant settings for Windows
  
@ifhostname name

Includes descendant settings if os.environ('HOSTNAME') == name

Added @ignore @data qt-gui-user-style-sheet to leoSettings.leo.
This contains  alternative active pane highlighting.

This completes enhancement #183: mprove focus-border handling in qt stylesheet
https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/183

It would be tricky, and not terribly useful, to fold this user stylesheet into
the main @data qt-gui-plugin-style-sheet, especially considering that
themes may want to use qt-gui-user-style-sheet.

Also, the default settings aren't bad, but I prefer to change qt-gui-user-style-sheet directly.
.. @+node:ekr.20150620103337.1: *4* Added new Themes machinery
leoSettings.leo now contains a new top-level node::

    @ignore Themes: copy to last top-level setting in myLeoSettings.leo

The body text tells what to do with it, namely:

To enable a theme:
   
1. Copy this entire tree to myLeoSettings.leo.
2. Move the tree so it is the last top-level node under @settings.
3. Remove the @ignore from the copy of this node.
4. Enable one of the three themes below by removing @ignore for its node.
5. Test by opening another Leo outline.

Important Notes

1. The "Themes" node does not define @data qt-gui-plugin-style-sheet.

Instead the new themes machinery uses the so-called "fully parameterized" stylesheet that we have all been using for at least several months now.  This stylesheet is defined as a descendant of the "Appearance" node.

2. The only functional theme is a new ekr_dark theme.  It illustrates how to use the new themes machinery.

- This theme uses a small, custom @data qt-gui-user-style-sheet that adjust colors around outline indicators.

- There is a tree call "Common to all themes" which contains settings that probably can be shared by most themes.  Naturally, setting in that tree can be overridden as you desire.

3. The new themes machinery is supposed to be completely self contained.  That is, there should be no need to use a script to generate a theme.

Yes, the user must fill in all appearance-related settings.  But most users will already have done this, so adjusting the settings for a theme should be straightforward.

4. The "Common to all themes" node contains an "Outline indicators" node that specifies a relative path to outline indicator icons (arrow icons or plus/minus) icons.  The path can be relative to either the users home directory or (as shown in leoSettings.leo) relative to the leo/Icons directory.

@language rest
@wrap

https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/177

Rev a1c8133:


Leo now more clearly shows the status of successful or failed searches in the status line. Imo, this is an important addition, especially for failed searches.  You could call this the last part of #177

Without this feedback, a failed search appears to do nothing, and my inevitable response was, "huh?, what just happened?"  The feedback is useful for successful searches, but successful searches change at least the selected text and often also change the selected node, so there is less huh? involved.

By default, Leo reports successful searches with white text on a blue background and failed searches with white text on a red background. These colors work pretty well even for dark themes.

You can choose these colors using the following settings in

    leoSettings.leo#@settings-->Appearance (change these first)-->
    Qt Gui settings-->Colors-->Status area colors::
   
         @color find-found-bg = blue
         @color find-found-fg = white
         @color find-not-found-bg = red
         @color find-not-found-fg = white
     
find.showStatus now gets proper colors from settings.

===== Matt

Wanted Leo function or plugin: Ctrl-X click or R-click {selected text} or ... that jumps to the associated node or function.

Consider the following code:

    print "Downloading", ', '.join(packages)
    for p in packages:
        do_download(p)
        ball(p)
        md5(p)

Wouldn't be nice to ctrl-click `do_download` and have Leo navigate to whatever node contains def do_download(): ?

    {={|{insert('{}');do('back-char')}|}

This is an implementation of auto-close-quotes, done entirely with abbreviations! For example, typing '(' inserts '()' and puts the cursor between the parens.

I personally dislike these abbreviations.  I find it harder to skip past the ')' than to type it later.  ymmv.

Leo now warns in the log pane and raises a summary dialog about possibly already-open files.  However, all files are opened as usual, leaving it to the user to determine what to do.

A (new?) bug *won't* be fixed.  Closing a file removes the file's entry from g.app.db, so reopening the file *again* won't give another warning.  This is a very minor matter.

What I did: (See app.Detecting already-open files)

- Added g.app.already_open_files list.
- Added calls to new runAlreadyOpenDialog method in c.open and LM.doPostPluginsInit.
- Rewrote app.checkForOpenFile.

- Added leo.commands.gotoCommands module.
- Removed almost all old code.
- Added goto.get_external_file_with_sentinels.
  This returns the external file *with* sentinels, even if
  it normally does not have sentinels.
- Added goto.scan_nonsentinel_lines & goto.scan_sentinel_lines.
  These contain the essential algorithms.
- Added code to force any particular write to use sentinels.
.. @+node:ekr.20150623053643.1: *5* checkin log 1
Several changes, preparing to simplify goto-global-line logic:

leoAtFile.py:
- Added at.scriptWrite ivar, set from the scriptWrite keyword arg to at.write.
- at.nodeSentinelText now writes full sentinels if at.scriptWrite is True.
  This makes sentinels available to goto-global-line.
  
leoCommands.py:
- Removed the now-unused "script" keyword argument from c.goToScriptLineNumber.
- Added GoToLineNumber.find_script_line.
  This explicitly sets up the goto-global-line logic for scripts.
  It may not be needed eventually, but for now it's a good step.
- Removed the scriptData keyword argument from GoToLineNumber.find_file_line.
  It's no longer needed now that GoToLineNumber.find_script_line exists.
  
leoAtShadow.py:
- AtShadowTestCase.makePrivateLines now calls at.write with scriptWrite=False.
  This retains the simplified node sentinels needed by AtShadowTestCase.
  All @shadow-related unit tests pass, so this change is benign.

leoGlobals.py:
- Added g.goto_last_exception.
  It works, modulo problems with goto-global-line.
  
unitTest.leo:
- Changed several unit tests re goto-global-line to reflect new signatures.

.. @+node:ekr.20150624062219.1: *5* checkin log 2
Created goto.scan_sentinel_lines, a complete, simple solution to finding lines in scripts.

Leo now automatically finds script lines that generate exceptions:

Still to do: associate lines in external files with nodes/offsets within an @<file> tree.
.. @+node:ekr.20150625112217.1: *5* checkin log 3
The grand changeover to the new line-number scheme. All tests pass.

leoAtFile.py:
- Added forceSentinels ivar and logic.
- Added forceSentinels keyword argument to at.writeOneAtAutoNode.
- Changed at.nodeSentinelsText (a major change):
    1. Made an explicit test for at_shadow_test_hack.
       This supports some mischief in the AtShadowTestCase.
    2. Otherwise, a full node sentinel is generated if::
    
        at.thinFile or at.scriptWrite or at.forceSentinels:
        
- In all other places, the write code generates sentinels if::

        at.sentinels or at.forceSentinels.
    
gotoCommands.py:
- debugged and improved goto.scan_sentinel/nonsentinel_lines.
- Moved the following to the attic:
    - countLines & helpers.
    - setup_file & setup_script.
    - find_vnode & helpers.
- All methods are now zero-based.

leoGlobals.py:
- g.gotoLastException adjust the calls to make them zero-based.

leoShadow.py
- makePrivateLines sets and clears the at.at_shadow_test_hack ivar
  rather than setting at.scriptWrite.

- Fixed several bugs that show up only when two comment delims are in effect.
- Added forceSentinels keyword argument of all write methods in subclasses of the BaseWriter class.
- The writer methods call the new BaseWriter.put_node_sentinel method when forceSentines is True. put_node_sentinel is similar to corresponding AtFile code.

Leo acts on some operator input when the Leo window is NOT the top window
https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/153

This problem is discussed in the Leo-Editor forum thread:
https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/leo-editor/3PPObn4JRik

I can't reliably reproduce this problem, so I can't give you a test case that demonstrates it.

The symptom that I first noticed was unexpected, unpredictable changes in what the tree pane showed when I switched back to Leo-Editor after switching away from Leo-Editor by executing open-url.

Sometimes the node selected was unchanged, but it had been scrolled up in the tree pane; and sometimes it had been scrolled all the way out of the tree pane.

Sometimes the node selected had been changed to a sibling node after the node that was selected when I switched away from Leo-Editor.

In all cases, the body pane correctly showed the contents of the currently selected node.

Sometimes an Alt-F4 when a non-Leo-Editor window is the only window showing, causes Leo-Editor to exit or display its "Save changes before exit?" query.

Edward K. Ream currently believes: "The culprit is likely a delayed action (on the order of 0.5 sec) that Leo takes on focus-in events. If the user responds to a focus-in event before that time there will be problems."

My test system:

Xubuntu32 12.04
Python 2.7.3, PyQt version 4.8.1

The problem has been observed on Leo-Editor commit f6cdb2b. It seems to occur slightly more frequently on more recent commits such as 42a5207.

https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/188
  
Rev e8b134:
    
Improved reporting of find options.  The report now shows suboutline-only and node-only.
- Just after Ctrl-F the status line contains:

    Find (wixbhacf[esn]): <list of options>

- When the command completes, the status line contains:

    found/not found (<list of options>): <find pattern>

This makes it much easier to see what is going on.

I suspect that #188 is invalid.  These changes will reduce confusion.

.. @+node:ekr.20150620062023.1: *4* My git work flow
Imo, git rivals python as the greatest productivity tool ever devised for programmers.

My workflow on Ubuntu and Windows is essentially identical. Simple aliases (Ubuntu) and .bat files (Windows) support the following console commands::

    gs  (expands to git status)
    gd (git diff)  Uses an external diff program,
                   but I'm starting to prefer text diffs.
    ga . (git add .)
    ga file (git add file)
    gc (git commit: configured to open Scite to create a commit message)
    gc -m "a one-line commit message"
    push (git push)

I use gitk on both platforms to review commits.

And that's about it. I use "git help" and "git help command" as needed.

.. @+node:ekr.20150703072334.1: *4* New commands greatly improve work flow
@language rest
@wrap

Recent revs make ctrl-click execute the find-def command if what is under the cursor is not a url.  There is no need to select the word--that's done automatically.

This quickly becomes indispensable. I have the following bindings defined, so there there is no need to move the mouse:

Ctrl-4: find-def
Ctrl-5: find-var

Furthermore, several recent changes/additions are remarkably useful:

clone-to-at-spot

This command does the following:

1. Clones the selected node.
2. Moves the clone to the last child of the last @spot node in the outline.
3. Collapses all nodes in the outline.
4. Selects the newly-cloned node, thereby making it visible.

I typically create the following project node:

   @spot re: the project name

pre-loaded find patterns

Today I improved the clone-find-all commands so they pre-select the find pattern more usefully.  leoPy.leo defines @button cfa-code as::

c.cloneFindAllFlattenedAtNode('Code',top_level=True)

This code now preloads the find pattern before selecting the top-level "Code" node.

These new and improved commands make a big difference to my work flow.
