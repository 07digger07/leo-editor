Leo holding directory/file handles after file close?

Open Leo
2. Create a new directory "test"
3. Create a new Leo file, save as "test/test.leo"
4. Create @file node in test.leo, save file.
5. Close test.leo, but keep Leo open (with another .leo open in a different tab)
6. Attempt to delete "test" directory <<-- FAILS, "open in another application"
7. Close Leo completely
8. Delete "test" directory <<-- Succeeds, now that Leo's closed

Actually, only just opening a .leo file without any @file nodes was enough to keep a file open.

The fix was to close theFile in fc.getLeoFile.

This will reduce duplicate scripts.
