#@+node:ekr.20131007055150.13036: *3* Improved reformat-paragraph
1. The following are always single-line paragraphs::
    
    @anything
    '''         # on a line all by itself. 
    """         # on a line all by itself.

2. The following always start a paragraph, terminating the previous
   paragraph::

    - Whatever
    1. Whatever
    22) Whatever
    a. Whatever # single character only.
    Z. Whatever # single character only.

3. The leading indentation in lists will be at least the the number of
   characters preceding "Whatever".

Not yet: support for non-breaking space (unicode code point U+00A0).

What I did:
    
- Rewrote c.findBoundParagraph & added helpers:
    - c.starts/endParagraph
    - c.singleLineParagraph.
- Add space adjustments to rp_wrap_all_lines.

#@+node:ekr.20131104024103.16526: *3* Fixed Haskell coloring problem
https://bugs.launchpad.net/leo-editor/+bug/1247672

In Haskell it is common to end certain functions with the single quote character. i.e.

sum = foldl' (+) 0

foldl' is a variety of the function foldl with modified characteristics. In
this case, it is strict.

The haskell syntax highlighter on Leo treats that single quote as the
beginning of a string.

As a note that may matter -- I don't know Leo so below may be non-important
I see this:

def haskell_rule4(colorer, s, i):
    return colorer.match_seq(s, i, kind="literal1", seq="' '",
        at_line_start=False, at_whitespace_end=False, at_word_start=False, delegate="")

In the leo/modes/haskell.py file.

Haskell does have strings that are surrounded by single quotes. Single
quotes are either (somewhat) regular characters or surround a single (
non-string ) character.

Gatesphere on the #Leo was helpful today and asked that I include the link
to this jedit xml syntax def for haskell:

http://jedit.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=jedit/jEdit.bak;a=blob_plain;f=modes/haskell.xml;hb=HEAD

Feel free to contact me if you need additional info.

====



Oh -- I should add that it is not uncommon to end function names with
multiple single quotes as well.

i.e.

sqrt
sqrt'
sqrt''
sqrt'''

for 4 different methods of determining square root.

The fix was a hack to match_keywords, and an alteration to rule28.

Using the LeoSetup-4.11-b1.exe installer with Python27 works fine.

However using Python33 it's not so happy. Selecting Start Menu>Leo does not launch Leo, I just see a flash of the splashscreen and it dies.
Same result using the desktop shortcut icon.

The target properties of the desktop icon are:
C:\Python33\pythonw.exe "C:\Program Files (x86)\Leo-4.11-b1\launchLeo.py"

I can run Leo from a console though. Here is the log:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Leo-4.11-b1>launchleo.py

** isPython3: True
Leo 4.11b1, build 5020, 2012-02-26 13:18:08 -0600
Python 3.3.3, qt version 4.8.5
Windows 6, 1, 7601, 2, Service Pack 1
...

Running from a command shell works fine with no errors.

Thanks for this report.

These look correct. And they work for me after a clean install. Note: the
initial load of Leo can take quite awhile: all .py files must be compiled.

For trouble shooting, please do the following:

- Change pythonw.exe to python.exe
- Add an -i option to the target properties.

The effect of this will be to run Leo in a console window, holding the
console window open.

This should tell you exactly what is happening.

I did find an issue related to the start menu. If I chose "All Programs"
then Leo, there was an old copy of the leo shortcut lying around that
didn't work. And even after deleting the Leo install, there was an old,
out-out-date Leo folder accessible from the start menu. And furthermore,
there were differences (from the start menu) between opening Leo and
opening Leo for all users.

This is surely confusing, but it may be the result of old installs.

My suggestion:

1. Uninstall b1.
2. Delete everything related to Leo from your start menu, both accessible
   via "search programs and files" and the "all programs list". Make sure
   to delete everything for all users as well as yourself.
3. Reinstall b1.
4. Test. If problems remain, make the changes above (-i, python.exe), and
   report the results.
