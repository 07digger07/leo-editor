#@+node:ekr.20131007055150.13036: *3* Improved reformat-paragraph
@language rest

1. The following are always single-line paragraphs::
    
    @anything
    '''         # on a line all by itself. 
    """         # on a line all by itself.

2. The following always start a paragraph, terminating the previous
   paragraph::

    - Whatever
    1. Whatever
    22) Whatever
    a. Whatever # single character only.
    Z. Whatever # single character only.

3. The leading indentation in lists will be at least the the number of
   characters preceding "Whatever".

Not yet: support for non-breaking space (unicode code point U+00A0).

What I did:
    
- Rewrote c.findBoundParagraph & added helpers:
    - c.starts/endParagraph
    - c.singleLineParagraph.
- Add space adjustments to rp_wrap_all_lines.
