.. @+node:ekr.20170619165453.1: ** Branch: string-gui
Status: merged into master

TM.doTests now runs all unit tests with string gui (StringTextWrapper class).

This has three advantages:

1. The tests run much more quickly than before.
2. Leo does no redraws during the tests.
3. Clicks in the Leo window can now longer spoil running unit tests.

Notes:

1. Several unit tests that require the qt gui now call skipTest.  This is an interim measure. 

2. TM.doTests contains a switch that determines which gui will be used.
.. @+node:ekr.20170807103720.1: ** Branch: redraw
Note: cc.selectChapterForPosition calls c.redraw *only* if the chapter changes.

- Investigate running unit tests without redraw.
  Related to string-gui branch: Use string/null gui for unit tests.
  https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/503

- Added support for c.redraw_later, called from cc.selectChapterForPosition.
- c.bringToFront now works without using c.outerUpdate.
- c.widgetWantsFocusNow now just calls c.set_focus & clears c.requestedFocusWidget.
- c.outerUpdate no longer handles recoloring or redrawing.
- Replaced all calls to c.recolor_now by c.recolor.
- Replaced all calls to redraw_now by redraw.
- Removed all calls to body.forceFullRecolor.
- Removed forceFullRecolorFlag.
- Done: removed c.incrementalRecolorFlag.
- Done: c.selectPosition never calls c.redraw. All unit tests pass.
- Done: Removed c.requestRedrawFlag and c.outerUpdate never calls c.redraw.  All tests pass.
.. @+node:ekr.20171120061142.1: ** #327: Create a way to unbind bindings in leoSettings.leo.
Rev 24da84a completes #327: Create a way to unbind bindings in leoSettings.leo.
https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/327

This enhancement allows you to override bindings made in leoSettings.leo or myLeoSettings.leo by setting:

    command-name = None

in the local .leo file, that is, outside of leoSettings.leo or myLeoSettings.leo. Important: binding:

    do-nothing = <key>

does not work.  That would eat <key> entirely.  Instead, the new code calls k.handleUnboundKeys when it sees any key previously bound to command-name.
