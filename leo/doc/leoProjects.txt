What I did:

- Added v.expandedPositions ivar.
- Wrote c.shouldBeExpanded.
- p.isExpanded calls c.shouldBeExpanded if p is a clone.
  This is important: it means that most code does not have to be aware of c.shouldBeExpanded.
- p.expand & p.contract maintain p.v.expandedPositions list.
- Rewrote & simplified p.isVisible.
- Left c.positionExists and p.isAncestorOf unchanged.
.. @+node:ekr.20131222112420.16373: *4* Notes
The idea is store "ephemeral" or position-related data **in vnodes*. This
is a completely new idea in Leo's history!

Suppose every vnode contains a new ivar: v.expandedPositions, a list of
(copies of) positions at which v is to be expanded. This would work as
follows:

1. Contracting a node at position p clears p.v.expandedPositions. The happy
   side effects is that contracting any clone will contract them all.

2. Expanding a node at position appends p.copy() to p.v.expandedPositions,
   and purges any no-longer-existing positions from that list.

3. nativeTree.drawChildren will expand nodes using c.shouldBeExpanded(p) instead of
   p.isExpanded(p).

As always, changing outline structure will invalidate positions. Because
c.p and all it's ancestors are always expanded, the worst that can happen
when an outline changes is that some positions that *aren't* the present
position will contract unexpectedly. Most such contraction will occur off
screen.
.. @+node:ekr.20131223064351.16352: *3* Improved p.isAncestorOf and c.positionExists
- Added test for c.positionExists to p.isAncestorOf.
- Added v.isNthChildOf
- Rewrote c.positionsExists using v.isNthChildOf
.. @+node:ekr.20131224124822.16717: *3* Fixed problems with clone-expansion
@language rest

Alt-End when the last top-level node was a clone caused all clones to expand.

The fix was in p.isAncestorOf.

Also, changed p.all_unique_positions() to p.all_positions() in places where p.contract was called.

I started this project by doing a clone-find-all for isExpanded.

Solution:

1. The "fix" at rev 6472 was wrong: The original code was correct.
2. Added a unit test.

Thanks to Terry Brown for these commands::

spell-as-you-type-toggle
  Enable / disable spell as you type mode.  When enabled, word ending
  keystrokes will put a short list of suggestions in the log window, if
  the word is unknown to the speller.  Only shows the first 5
  suggestions, even if there are more.

spell-as-you-type-next
  Cycle the word behind (left of, for ltr languages) the cursor through
  the full list of suggestions.

spell-as-you-type-undo
  Change the word behind (left of, for ltr languages) the cursor to
