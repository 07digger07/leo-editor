Description: Leo is::
    
        An outliner. Everything in Leo is an outline.
        A browser that remembers where you were the last time.
        A uniquely powerful scripting environment.
        A superb tool for studying other people's code.
        A fully-featured IDE.
        A uniquely-extensible Personal Information Manager.
        Written in 100% pure Python.
   
    Leo's *unique* features::
    
        Always-present, persistent, outline structure.
        Leo's outline is a Directed Acyclic Graph.
        Clones create mutliple views of an outline.
        A simple, powerful, outline-oriented Python API.
        Scripts and programs can be composed from outlines.
        Importers convert flat text into outlines.
        Scripts have full access to all of Leo's sources.
        A plugin architecture makes it easy to extend Leo.
        Plugins for IPython, vim and xemacs
        Hundreds of minibuffer commands, just like Emacs.
        Many other unique commands that act on outline structure.
        Example: the rst3 command converts outlines to reStructuredText.
        @test and @suite scripts create unit tests automatically.
        @button scripts apply scripts to data.
        Outline-oriented directives.

    Simulating these features in vim or Emacs is possible,
    but, heh, so is simulating Python in assembly language.::
