Leo 5.4-final   October 22, 2016

[Leo](http://leoeditor.com/) 5.4 is now available on [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/leo/files/Leo/). 

Leo is an IDE, outliner and PIM, as described [here] (http://leoeditor.com/preface.html).

Simulating Leo's features in Vim, Emacs or Eclipse is possible, just as it is possible to simulate Python in assembly language...
